It is better to think of project durations as a range, rather than a single number.

Establishing a min and max duration facilitates the visualisation of potential project duration 'swing' using a tornado chart.

Categories with no bars indicate that there is no variability in those tasks.

Tools such as [Crystal Ball](https://www.oracle.com/uk/middleware/technologies/crystalball.html) automates 'Monte Carlo Simulations' that allow us to identify the % chance that a project will be completed within the estimated duration. Additionally, these tools will tell us the % likelihood that a task will end up on the critical path. Which menas we can prioritise all tasks accordingly to mitigate the risk in the project.

Monte Carlo Sims can also be used for budgeting.
