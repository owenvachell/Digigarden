Consider:
- Parkinson's Law
	- A task will take as long as the time allocated to it
- Student's syndrome
	- work on a task will start towards the end of the alloted timeframe allocated to it
- Overconfidence
	- people will tend to say a task will take less time than it actually does
- Biases
	- anchoring
		- if someone is asked "will this task take 2 or 3 weeks" they will typically only consider those numbers
	- confirmation
		- reporting a task will take as long as it took last time

### Due diligence
The critical path is the longest amount of time a project will take. Any delays to tasks that are on the critical path will result in a delay to the overall project. This is how to analyse and identify the critical path 

#### Early start, early finish
Take the finish time the latest finishing, previous dependent task and add the new task length. Do this for all tasks.

#### Late start, late finish
Work backwards from the early start, early finish calculations. Use the earliest late start figure from the upstream task to subtract the current task length and get the current task late start value.

By identifying the gaps between early and late starts halps to spot any slack in the project

When ==early start = late start==, these are **critical** tasks
