### On This Day...

[[2020-05-04]]

### Hey Owen, Whats On Your Mind? 
Bit careless last night. Took Red out for a quick walk that turned into a hike round a mountain. It was unplanned and I underestimated the difficulty of the walk. The wind was blowing a gale. Red has gotten too old to handle this level of walk so I had to carry her all the way home because she was in pain. I also worried Tara, who thought we'd only be gone half hour, max. That turned into 2 hours and we only just made it back before dark. 

**18:11**
Noticing that I'm not feeling guilty about not doing anything in Wales, or that I don't feel like we're wasting our time here. It's really nice to sit and not do anything. We've spent the majority of our time in the lounge, by the fire, reading books. Just the three of us. Except Red - she hasn't been reading! Just snoring.
