### On This Day...

[[2020-05-06]]

### Hey Owen, Whats On Your Mind? 
Explored some more unknown (to me) places yesterday. Some incredible scenery. I was out for 3 hours and didn't see a single person. It was AWESOME!!! Taking Tara along the same route today. Being here makes me want to get back into landscape photography again. The walk I did yesterday was the perfect location scout. I found so many spots that would make for incredible sunrise photos, given the right conditions, of course. The expense of needing to invest in another camera puts me off though. Perhaps I could get into it with medium format film instead? That would be cool!
