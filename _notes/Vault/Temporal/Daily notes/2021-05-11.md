#### Tuesday 11th May 2021
Trained last night. I don't usualy feel motivated in the evening but for some reason I did this time. So I made the most of it and got my training session done. It felt good.

I think I got the proportions wrong in my smoothie this morning. It's a bit thick. Try less fruit next time. I'll need to go to Tesco on Poole Quay on my way into work this morning to get some veg for my lunch.

##### NS1 Interview
NS1 is exciting because it's improving the foundations of the apps and services that rely on the internet. The internet is where people go to solve problems. NS1 are providing the backbone to that problem solving medium.

App providers need:
efficient and scalable dev environments and stable ops environments

I'm a big believer in the user experience. One of the biggest bug bears for me is apps that are slow to respond
