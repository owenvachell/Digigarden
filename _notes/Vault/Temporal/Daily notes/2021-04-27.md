### On This Day...

[[2020-04-27]]

### Hey Owen, Whats On Your Mind? 
Submitted my assignment last night so I didn't need the extension I asked for after all. Although, I do think it took the pressure off and allowed me to be more focussed with it. either way, it's a massive relief to have it completed on time. One more to go. I think I'm going to have to change my strategy with how I approach [[Study Routine|studying]]. I don't like to study to just pass an assignment. I want to absorb the content and understand how it applies in the wider context of the world. However, in doing so, I feel unprepared for the assignement when the deadline is approaching. I believe the answer is to do both. I can keep studying the way I am but additionally consider what is required in the assignment and make sure I'm capturing organised notes that will help with my assignment.
