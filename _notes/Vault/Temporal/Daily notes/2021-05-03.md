### On This Day...

[[2020-05-03]]

---

### Hey Owen, Whats On Your Mind? 
First full day in Wales. Slept in until 9. Can't remember the last time I did that. I don't think I realise how tired I am or how hard I've been working. Tara tells me a lot but I just shrug it off as I think I see other people working harder than me. Interestingly I'm feeling a little anxious about not checking my work emails. Makes me realise how little I've switched off in the last year, maybe even two years. 

It's raining here but I don't care. The plan for today has always been to do as little as possible. A quick stop at no.1 Coffee for breakfast, food shop for the week and a new waterproof jacket. Then it's back to our cosy cottage to chill by the fire, catch up with PN, do some studying and read a book. I'm so godamn happy!
