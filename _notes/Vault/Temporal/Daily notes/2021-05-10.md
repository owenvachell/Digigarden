#### Monday 10th May 2021
Back to work. First and foremost, I need to up my fruit and veggie intake again. The week in Wales has been great and I got plenty of exercise. But my nutrition game was poor. Today I'll go to Tesco on Poole Quay and grab some greens and something tasty to go in a salad. Either fish or feta cheese.

Fruit and veggie intake went well! Steve asked me if I wanted a pasty and I was too easily swayed. Moral of this story is to take lunch to work with me. 

[[What's on my mind]]
