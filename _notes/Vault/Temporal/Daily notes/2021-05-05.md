### On This Day...

[[2020-05-05]]

---

### Hey Owen, Whats On Your Mind? 
Another blissful day of doing nothing. The weather is glorious outside so I'll want to take myself off for a walkk at some point. It was supposed to be raining all day so I haven't made any plans to go out. Been mostly studying, which is feeling less like a chore now that I have more headspace. On the contrary, I'm actually really enjoying it again. I sometimes question my motives for wanting to pursue a degree when it puts so much pressure on me and stops being fun. I'll stop doubting my pursuit of this degree if I can remeber this feeling. To help me achieve that, I could go outside more for long walks.
