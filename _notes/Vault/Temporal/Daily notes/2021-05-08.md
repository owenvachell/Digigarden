### Hey Owen, Whats On Your Mind? 
Coming to the end of our holiday. It's been such a fantastic week. We've managed to strike the perfect balance of awesome walks and relaxation time. The weather is awful today, which suits us. Muscles are a little achy from all of the walking (in a good way) and we've both got some studying to catch up on. I've just had a bath, which is what Tara's doing now while I'm siting around in my PJ's. Having a roast dinner tonight. Perfect!

In other news, I spoke to Dad this morning about a technoloogy project he might need some help with. I'm chuffed to bits that he thought to ask me and am really ecited about the prospect of working together on it with him. It's perfect timing too as the project will fit in between finishing uni in May and starting again next October. Watch this space!
