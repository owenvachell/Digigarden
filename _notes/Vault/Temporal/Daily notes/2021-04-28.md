### On This Day...

[[2020-04-28]]

---

### Hey Owen, Whats On Your Mind? 
Terrible day at work. Steve clearly doesn't have a clue of the complexities that go into any of the tasks that run the technical side of the business. He's also happy to fudge things for short term gain at the expense of the solutions longevity. Meaning we (I) end up solving the same problems multiple times. When I question the solution and mention it's worth spending a little extra time on a proper solution now, he's clearly not interested. It's increasingly obvious that Steve doesn't want thinkers, just people that do as he says.
