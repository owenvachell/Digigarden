**Synopsis:**
Describes how Earths stability is tightly correlated with biodiversity. So to reverse the devastating impact of climate change, biodiversity must be restored. 

## Notes
Page 5:
Climate change is Chernobyl in slow motion, but far more devastating. They both share a “damaging lack of care and understanding”

Page 9:
The people of Pripyat lived there happily knowing the dangers of living so close to a nuclear reactor. It provided comfortable lifestyles by way of employment, much like the things that are causing climate change. 

Page 18:
Humans have a unique ability to create cultures (passing ideas from one to another by teaching or imitation). 

Page 20:
Lack of temperature variability seen throughout the Holocene created a stable environment that allowed humans to thrive. 

This was helped by the vast biodiversity.

Why grazing herds are so important;
* Herds eat the leaves close to the ground
* Regrowth comes from sustenance reserves below the surface
* Ground is broken up by herds hooves
* Plants shed their seeds in the broken up soil, starting the next generation of grass

All of the above becomes impossible in the absence of herds as taller plants would grow and shadow the grass, preventing it from growing. 

Page 37:
Space is essential in supporting the above process. Without it, herds would have nowhere to move on once all the grass had been eaten. As a result, the grass would not get the respite it needs to re-grow and the herds would go hungry. The hungry herds would become weak, making them easy prey. But this means their predators would also quickly run out of food. 

> I relate to this to being like horses needing 2 paddocks. One to graze in while the other rests.   

Page 51:
Tribes are an example of how humans used to (and perhaps still should) live. In perfect harmony with the surrounding natural habitat, producing no waste and consuming only what the land can renewably offer.

How are humans currently impacting the gorilla population of Rwanda?

What’s the trade like for hunting gorillas for souvenirs? 
```

Page 58:
Gorillas are unfairly labelled as aggressive because it is only when the family group are threatened that the dominant male becomes aggressive. 

Similarities between humans and gorillas:
* Sight
* Hearing
* Sense of smell 
* Social groups (sorts of, with largely permanent family relationships)
* The way we walk on the ground

Humpback whale recovery since the hunting ban shows how quickly nature can recover.

What about Polar Bears, that are facing the same fate? Their struggles are more challenging due to the retreating ice, which is their hunting ground.

Marine mammals can grow much larger than terrestrial mammals as their weight is supported by the water. Their bones would break if not. 

Where there is plenty of nutrients, life (including plants) can exist on the surface. When they die, they drift downward as ‘marine snow’. Without nutrients, the surface waters become sterile. Sunlight is also important. This is similar to the principles mentioned above with grazing herds. Marine snow is carried upwards on marine currents, whipped up by underwater terrain. This is where fish and phytoplankton flourish. The rest of the ocean would be vast open space were it not for the whales. 

The ‘whale pump’ refers to the activity performed by whales that involves their great range of movement. From deep diving for food to surfacing for air, this activity stirs up the nutrients in the water and helps to keep it near the surface. Defacation also enriches the water. This process is seen as more productive in the production of nutrients than the flow of water from rivers. 

Page 64:
Whale song is so low frequency that it can travel hundreds of kilometres. Each whale is distinctly recognisable by their song, which evolves over time and can be learned from each other. This shows evidence of a culture, similar to that mentioned on page 18. 

Hunting whales became banned thanks to the widespread message of anti-whaling campaigners that showed the barbaric nature of whaling. So multimedia storytelling is an important tool in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss. 

Page 70:
There are no seasons in the rainforest and the sun always shines for 12 hours a day, which means that plants and wildlife can flourish year round. 

Page 74:
Destroying the rainforests for timber and agricultural reasons, such as harvesting palm oil, is destroying the orang-utan habitat, pushing them to extinction. 

Page 76:
As the oceans are so deep, they make up 97% of our planets inhabitable space. 

Page 82:
When the oceans fish numbers are dwindling, Subsidies paid to support the fishing industry in countries with large fleets meant that they were effectively paid to overfish. 

[[5 ways harmful fisheries subsidies impact coastal communities | Stories | WWF]]

Large female fish produce disproportionately more eggs than smaller ones. So removing the larger fish not only reduces their numbers but their species capacity to reproduce. 

`Is this a positive feedback loop?`

Page 83:
Advances in fishing technology including nets, GPS, echo sounders and marine engines have led to a surge in fishing, causing the global stock to become depleted.

Page 85:
Shifting baseline syndrome - a phenomenon where people don’t realise there’s a lack of something because they weren’t around to see how much of it there used to be. For example, we may not think of fish populations as depleted because we haven’t seen how abundant they were before they were overfished. 

Page 88:
The effect we are having on the worlds ocean is similar to that of the Permian extinction, but over a much shorter time period. 

Page 93:
Retreating sea ice is reducing the size of polar bear hunting grounds. Due to the lack of food, female bears are giving birth to smaller Cubs. If they become too small, their Cubs won’t survive winter, which will wipe out the polar bear population. 

Smaller amounts of ice also means less resting places for mammals such as walruses, who also have to travel further. As a result, walruses are gathered closer together on densely crowded beaches. This could easily be portrayed by climate contrarians as a booming walrus population.

Beef production is the main driver for deforestation and is double that of the second (soy - used to feed livestock), third (oil palm plantations) and fourth driver. 

Page 98:
Land misused by agriculture is causing major flooding due to the degradation of the top soil. Factors that contribute to this are use of chemicals that kills the insects and bacteria that nourish the soil.

## Future predictions 
**2030**
Page 113:
Forest dieback in the Amazon, causing mass flooding, extinction of species and displacement of indigenous people. 

Forest dieback will also vastly accelerate climate change as there will be less trees to remove carbon from the atmosphere. 

Ice free summers in the Arctic would increase Earths albedo, once again accelerating climate change. The algae that sits on the bottom of the ice and supplies the rest of the food chain would end up drifting in the water. 

**2040** 
Page 115:
Thawing of the permafrost causing widespread flooding, catastrophic landslides and sink holes that decimate local communities and wildlife. The 1400 gigatonnes of carbon (four times the level emitted over the last 200 years) locked in the permafrost would also be gradually released

**2050**
P age 116:
The resulting acceleration of carbon in the atmosphere from the above effects will cause the oceans to become more acidic, destroying reefs and the fish populations, which could disappear forever. 

## A vision for the future
50% of humans impact on the natural world is attributable to the wealthiest 16%

Choose change not growth. Hunans must look at alternative measures to GDP and focus on people centric ways of measuring success. New Zealand lead the way here as they no longer use GDP. They have been one of the most successful countries in managing Covid. 



"The ocean covers two-thirds of the surface of the planet. Its great depths mean that it contains an even greater proportion of inhabitable space. So there is a special role for the ocean in our revolution to rewild the world. By helping the marine world to recover, we can do three things we desperately need to do simultaneously capture carbon, raise biodiversity and supply ourselves with more food. It starts by working with the industry that is currently causing most damage to the ocean fishing."
