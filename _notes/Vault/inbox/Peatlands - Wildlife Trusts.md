- Key points
	- Peatlands store vast carbon but at the moment are emitting carbon due to drying and draining of peat
	- Keeps water clean 
	- Provides flood defences
	- Provide us with drinking water
	- Example rehabilitation project (Derrybrat bog):
		- area was naturally re-vegetating `what does this mean for the peat?`
		- re-wetting raised water levels
			- which encouraged the natural development of wet vegetation
		- re-wetting essential for ecosystem services
			- biodiversity
			- flood control
			- control of carbon emissions
		- water table close to bog surface
			- critical for re-establishing peatland habitats
			- water logged conditions are needed to re-wet the peat
				- leads to dev of:
					- fen
					- reedbeds
					- wet woodland habitats
						- creating habitats for wildlife
							- wintering swans
							- egrets
	- rotational burning an issue
		- `more research needed. look back to around 60-70 minutes in to the video`
- Wildlife:
	* Short eared owl 
	* Golden plover
	* Adder
	* Sundew
	* Emperor moth
	* Curlew
- Wildlife Trust belief:
	- the sale of Peat based products should be banned.
	[How to go peat free at home | The Wildlife Trusts](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/actions/how-go-peat-free)
	- burning peat should be banned
- UK peatland strategy
	- goal: 2 million ha restored by 2040
		- halfway there atm
		- land use policy important
			- conflicts between
				- peatland
				- wind farms
				- trees
	- most peat sold in the UK imported, including from Canada which has high amounts of embedded water.
		- this is an issue that needs to change. Peat should not be sold AT ALL
	- See video, around 45 minutes in
		- [YouTube](https://youtu.be/5mL-TGoCkFw)
- My questions
	- What products are peat based?
	- how old are peatlands?
	- What happens when peatlands flood?
	- What are the different types of peatland?
		- fens
		- etc
