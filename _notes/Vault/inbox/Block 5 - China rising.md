## Part 1 - Economic growth and rise of middle class

Focusing on China helps us frame the questions that need to be asked to engage with the often conflicting demands of economic growth and maintaining a diverse and healthy environment

- Chinas economic growth has been shared with its people

  Between 1981 and 2010, China pulled 680 million people out of poverty, which means that whereas in 1980 as many as 84% of the population lived in poverty, in 2010 this figure was 10%

	- Better health

		- Lower death rates in children under 5

			- Better nutrition
			- Better availability of vaccines

		- Better mortality rates

			- Improvements not as significant as child death rates under 5 likely due to pollution levels, which is the worst in the world

	- Better literacy rates
	- Data to be interpreted with caution due to secrecy of Chinese political system

		- China reported fewer than 300 new cases annually of HIV/AIDS infection in the early years of the 1990s (United Nations, 2008, p. 2)

- Inequality

  Poverty has declined as a result of Chinas economic growth. However, inequality has grown. This is typical of capitalist systems. China was more equal under communism.

	- Gender

	  There are more opportunities for men in China than for women
	  
	  More boys are born than girls. Likely due to one child rule in 1979 which resulted in selective gender based abortions. However boys are more likely to die
	  
	  State laws on property mean that men own the house if a married couple become divorced
	  
	  Women forced to retire 5 years earlier than men by law, giving men better earning capacity 

	- East-West

	  Earnings for population decreases with longitude heading west.

	- Rural-Urban

	  Cities have better access to water and sanitation
