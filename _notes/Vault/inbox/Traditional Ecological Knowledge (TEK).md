TEK is Indigenous knowledge about the environment (see Box 4.1 for a summary of what makes it distinctive as a form of knowledge)

* Difference to traditional science

```
- Written forms of communication, including data visualisation, has meant that information can be presented to and consumed by a wider audience. Being written down also means that the same information is around longer, unlike the spoken word.
- Focuses on things from an isolated perspective
```

* Challenges

```
- Non-indigenous researchers often think indigenous people have nothing to offer on the topic of economic impacts of the factors that affect climate change.
```

```
	- Example: researchers may consult with local peoples on local wildlife matter, such as polar bears, but not the socioeconomic impact of mining.
```

```
- Who gets to decide the definition of ‘traditional’
```

* Principles

```
- Flexible
```

```
  TEK is dynamic and flexible in its approaches, recognising that things change over time. so, it could be said that TEK is a progressive way of studying places.
```

```
- Holistic
```

```
  Studies the relationship between different things
```

```
- Local
```

```
  Knowledge that is closely linked to the long-time local inhabitants of an area.
```

```
	- More context specific
	- Not linked to people, but inhabitants
```

```
		- People may move to an area, retaining existing knowledge.
		- Knowledge of an area may not be directly applicable to the people that live there currently
```

```
- Oral
```

```
  Transfer of knowledge between people and generations by word of mouth
```

```
	- This is how humans develop cultures and what distinguishes from the rest of the animal kingdom
```

### Types of TEK

* Storied TEK
	* Repeating the same information through storytelling as a learning method. (See ilisayuq).

```
- This is once again an example of how culture plays an important role in the evolution of humans
```

```
	- There is an assumption that this type of TEK can be learned anywhere such as books, online, classrooms etc
```

```
		- Makes it popular among outside researchers
```

```
	- Learned before it is applied
```

```
		- This seems to be the stage that researchers are at with TEK
```

```
- Skilled TEK
```

```
	- Experience based
```

```
		- For example: weather prediction is a skill that cannot be learned simply by passing it down a generation through storytelling.
```

```
	- Cannot be displaced from an individual
```

### Views of the scientific community

* Negative

```
- Specialisation
```

```
	- ‘TEK only offers a qualitative approach’
```

```
	  This also denies the skilled aspect of TEK, in addition to minimising the importance of qualitative research
```

```
	- ‘Science is too specialised’.
```

```
	  This denies the skilled side of TEK
```

```
	- Some scientists fear that TEK in scientific research risks exploitation of the indigenous people.
```

```
- Positive
```

```
	- Integration
```

```
		- Indigenous people are more integrated with their environment, which can in turn mean that they integrate well with environmental science
