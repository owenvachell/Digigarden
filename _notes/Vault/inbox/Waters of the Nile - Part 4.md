> "The cycle requires energy to keep it turning and this is provided by the Sun. The Sun's heat causes evaporation of water, principally from the oceans. The water vapour it produces is moved around by winds and may condense into clouds. Rain and snow, collectively known as precipitation, fall from the clouds. The water runs off the land and collects into streams and rivers, whichflow down to the sea and complete the cycle" ([Furniss :142](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=23))

The water cycle ([note on p.142](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=23))

> "As well as evaporating from the oceans, water also evaporates from lakes, rivers, marshes and other freshwater sources into the atmosphere. In addition, it evaporates from the soil and from the surface of the leaves of plants. Plants draw water up through their roots to the leaves, from where some evaporates into the atmosphere in the process of transpiration. These combined processes of water loss are known as evapotranspiration" ([Furniss :142](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=23))

^842a5a

Evapotranspiration ([note on p.142](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=23))

> "Depending on geological conditions, the infiltrating water may become part of the reservoir of groundwater which can be found in some permeable rocks. Water, and other liquids such as oil, can pass into and through permeable rocks (as opposed to impermeable rocks) in tiny spaces within their structure. Underground rock strata that hold water are called aquifers" ([Furniss :142](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=23))

^a3024a

Aquifers and how liquids move through geology ([note on p.142](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=23))

> "Our need for water, and that of other land animals and plants, is met by tapping into the water cycle at some point between precipitation onto land and discharge back to the sea. Almost all our water is abstracted from rivers and lakes or from aquifers via wells and boreholes. We rely on the processes of the water cycle to constantly replenish and renew our supply" ([Furniss :143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=24))

^affd47

How we access water as a resource ([note on p.143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=24))

> "One component of the water cycle that varies depending on where you are in the world is evaporation, which is directly related to temperature" ([Furniss :143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=24))

^ac8b36

Water cycle variable ([note on p.143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=24))

> "It is the longest river in the world, but it is way down the list at about the 90th largest river in terms of volume of discharge" ([Furniss :143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=24))

![[importance of the nile to egypt]]

> "North of the confluence with the Atbara the volume of the Nile decreases, partly because of the losses due to evaporation as the waterflows through the desert. This is one of the reasons why the Nile waters are so precious to Egypt" ([Furniss :143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=24))

^2484d0

Importance of the Nile to Egypt ([note on p.143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=24))

> "Renewable resources can be regenerated or replenished over short, or relatively short, timescales" ([Furniss :144](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=25))

Renewable definition  ([note on p.144](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=25))

> "Non-renewable resources, like coal, are different. Coal is formed by the decomposition of plant material, but the full cycle of transition from the deposition of vegetation to the formation of hard coal would take many millions of years" ([Furniss :144](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=25))

Non-renewable definition; the important part being the length of time ([note on p.144](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=25))

> "For non-renewable resources such as oil or copper, another important concept is reserves. Reserves of a particular resource are those parts of it which: (a) have been proven to exist, for example by exploratory drilling (b) can be recovered by mining or some other method of extraction" ([Furniss :146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=27))

Reserves ([note on p.146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=27))

> "Even when a resource is recoverable, it may not make sense to extract it, for instance because the reserve is small, is of poor quality, or is too deep below the surface of the Earth. In such cases, extraction would be too expensive relative to the potential profit and so not economically sensible. Consequently, there is a further distinction between reserves and usable reserves, that is, the reserves that are economically and technically available for extraction" ([Furniss :146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=27))

Factors affecting extraction of resources ([note on p.146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=27))

> "Exploration leading to further discoveries, technological developments in extraction techniques and, importantly, the changing economic value of the end product will all influence the size of the usable reserve" ([Furniss :146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=27))

Factors affecting resource extraction change over time ([note on p.146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=27))

> "if geological changes lead to aquifers being sealed by impermeable rock layers, there is no longer any recharge. The water remains'locked' in the sealed aquifer and is effectively removed from the water cycle and therefore becomes a non-renewable resource" ([Furniss :146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=27))

The concept of fossil water ([note on p.146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=27))

> "It extends over an area of more than 2 million km2 in North Africa beneath Egypt, Sudan, Libya and Chad, and is an extremely important water resource in this region" ([Furniss :146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=27))

An important source of water called the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) used for irrigation and domestic supply ([note on p.146](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=27))

> "One question that arises over the use of any aquifer is who owns it. The NSAS extends beneath four countries and, of course, its boundaries do not correspond to the national borders at the surface" ([Furniss :149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=30))

A potential source of conflict over water ([note on p.149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=30))

> "The potential for conflict over underground water resources, where the origin of the water and the exact extent of the aquifer may not be known, is clear to see. For this reason, as a transboundary system, the management of the NSAS depends on collaboration and cooperation between the stakeholder countries. In September 2013, the governments of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad formalised an agreement for joint management of the shared aquifer" ([Furniss :149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=30))

^b8d415

The approach to NSAS seems amicable ([note on p.149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=30))
