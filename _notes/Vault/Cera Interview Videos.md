##### What is your favourite product and why? If you owned this product, what feature would you consider adding next?

Hello, my name's Owen Vachell. I'd like to take a moment at the end of this video to express my gratitude for the opportunity you have given me with this interview process. But I'm sure that you're all very busy people so first and foremost I'll focus on answering the question.

My favourite product is my Apple watch. The wealth of data it provides about myself and makes readily available on my phone feels incredibly empowering. I'm confident that wearables are on Cera's radar, if not already integrated into your product so it feels like this might be an obvious answer for this job interview. But I do enjoy spending time using the Apple Shortcuts app to autonomously extract the data my watch stores so that I can analyse it. 

If I owned this product, the next feature that I would add is a longer battery life. All of the bells and whistles that you can possibly imagine for any product become useless if the battery runs flat.

So, as I said at the start, I'd like to take a moment to express my gratitude and why I'm excited about this opportunity. As I said in my covering letter, I'm keen to be involved in a role that makes a tangible, positive difference to people's lives. Having watched several YouTube videos about Cera I can see that you're doing exactly that. The "Welcome to Cera" video made me truly excited about the company and I got a little emotional watching why Macie became a carer with Cera. I was also incredibly impressed by the clarity of vision for Cera displayed by CEO, Ben Marithapu during his Sky News interview and the empathy he showed on the BBC when interviewed about the governments COVID-19 vaccination strategy.

I hope my enthusiasm for Cera is coming across in this video. I strongly believe that this enthusiasm can be an asset to the team as we strive to care better, together.
