1. Why do I want to get in better shape?

I want to feel more energetic and move well without pain or discomfort

2. And why does that matter?

I’ll be more motivated to do the things I enjoy in life, like being outside more

3. Why do I want to be outside more?

Being outside makes me happy and helps me to feel relaxed. The pressures of daily life slip away when I’m enjoying nature.

4. Why do I want to feel more relaxed?

Work can be stressful and I tend to manifest that in a way that isn’t constructive, which has an impact on my home life and my relationship with Tara. Being calmer and with a clearer mind when we’re together will also help me to be more present and engage on a deeper level.

5. And why is that important?

Tara is the single most important person in my life. I don’t want to do anything that might damage what we have
