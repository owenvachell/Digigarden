*Timed free writes* - set a timer for 5 minutes and don’t stop writing.  It doesn’t matter how carp it is.  It’s a brain dump

## Prompts (20 minute timer):
Life defining experiences - a before and after story
An experience that changed my mind about something
Something I thought I wanted but glad I didn’t get in hindsight

Connect personal to the universal to help people connect to the story.  Details that may have happened to somebody else to make it relatable 

## Exercises:
### Writing from convictions:
List 5-10 personal and strongly held beliefs or convictions
OR
A similar list that of things that I’ve changed my mind about

Pick the one I feel most energised about, write about it for 5 minutes (timed free write).  Then list experiences that helped to form that belief/conviction or change my mind.

Pick the most significant experience and write about it for 20 minutes.

Braid the parts together

### Asking/answering questions:
Think of 3 q’s I ruminate on regularly

Choose one, free write about it with a brief synopsis of a story on the origin for that question

Hone in on most critical juncture - 20 minute story writing

How does the story illustrate the question
- - - -

### What you resist persists:
List 3 issues I’ve been wrestling with for all/most of my life

Create timeline of significant and related events

Write specifically about the issue and how the story illustrates it.

## Closing tips:
Be descriptive.  For example, did I just ‘get dressed’ or did I ‘step into my favourite blue jeans, put on a freshly pressed shirt bla bla bla …..’ - *be specific*

Leave time to mull on the essay to find the ‘intellectual hook’ (what is the essay REALLY about)  eg. What I think this essay about is x but imagine/perhaps it’s about y (don’t insist it IS about y. Allow room for contemplation)

Revising the draft
How to make it more ‘me’
What tone is the essay in (essay’s should be conversational)
Be vulnerable but strike a balance to not being TOO vulnerable
No ‘humble bragging
Don’t overshare
Be harder on yourself than others without beating yourself up
