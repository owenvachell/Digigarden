## Introduction
Home to 10% of the worlds species,  many of which are endemic, the Amazon is one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet. It stores enormous amounts of carbon. Land cover is changing from forests, which store carbon, to agriculture, an industry that produces carbon. This is also at the expense of the vast biodiversity in the region.

Much of the activity is undertaken illegally. But the growing population of people living in poverty within the Amazon region are left with little choice.

All of these issues make the activity in the Amazon a global concern.

## Stakeholders
- Brazil
	- Although Brazil has the largest land mass of Amazon rainforest, it is not the country with the Amazon as the largest share of its land.
- Peru
- Guayana
- Venezuela
- Colombia
- Ecuador
- Peru
- Bolivia
- Indigenous tribes
	- Borders for tribes often don’t share the same definition as the political boundaries that define countries. This means that tribe communities often transcend nation states. 
	- 
	- Often live in environmentally protected areas

> Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana all have political borders along the Amazon basin boundary. This may have made sense to the colonial powers when they established their territorial borders, but it has been very damaging to many Indigenous tribes, whose traditional territories straddle these borders. For example, the Yanomami have been divided by the Venezuelan/Brazilian border (Figure 3), the Makushi by the Guyanese/Brazilian border, and the Tiriyó by the Surinamese/Brazilian border. Many individuals from these tribes now cross the border illegally in order to visit family members and/or trade with their own community members.  

## Exports
- Soya
	- Brazil is the largest producer in the world
- Mahogany
	- Brazil is the 3rd largest supplier of wood-based products
- Beef
	- Brazil is the fourth largest supplier of beef
- Gold

## Concerns
- Mass deforestation to support agriculture because of the demand for South American beef.
	- Most deforested areas are now used as cropland, the majority of which for Soya beans.
- Illegal gold mining. 98% of gold mines in the Amazon are illegal.
- Illegal deforestation for the sale of mahogany.
- Social issues which mean that the growing local population need to pursue the above-mentioned illegal activities in order to survive.
- Road construction
	- **Potential for political conflict** : Guayana resistant to upgrade roads that transit North Rupununi wetlands. The road would make journeys shorter for delivering Brazilian goods to the coast where they’re exported by sea. Upgrading the road would destroy an area that is rich in aquatic biodiversity.
	- Deforestation happens along the routes where there are already roads as that is where it’s easiest to get vehicles in and out.
