Just a short ferry ride from Liverpool and an hour’s flight from Scotland, Northern Ireland blends centuries of rich history and folklore with an energetic mix of modern culture and breathtaking landscapes. Of course, there are the sorts of country retreats that Northern Ireland is famous for: indulging in creamy pints of Guinness and coastal views in Antrim; pony hacking in the grounds of Crom Castle in Fermanagh; or relaxing in the evening sun after a trek through the rolling woodlands surrounding the picturesque Lough Erne.
 

Just as tempting, though? The lesser-known but nonetheless magnificent havens dotted around Northern Ireland’s six provinces. Below, we’ve rounded up the most breathtaking and off-the-beaten-track places to visit in Northern Ireland.

Get away from it all at Rathlin Island, Northern Ireland's northernmost speck of land. Take the local ferry from Ballycastle, which takes between 25 and 45 minutes. What to expect? A quaint port village with approximately 150 locals and a thriving and diverse ecosystem. The island is best explored by [bicycle](https://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/article/fashion-memories-cycling) or by foot: expect walks with serious wow factor.

 

## Cuilcagh Boardwalk Trail, County Fermanagh

Savour the quintessentially Irish landscape at Ireland’s “stairway to heaven”: a 33km walking labyrinthine that encapsulates the winding hills of Cuilcagh Mountain and the surrounding area over tracks, boardwalks and staircases. A steep climb is required to reach the viewing platform on Cuilcagh Mountain, but the breathtaking views of the surrounding lowlands make the journey a worthwhile one.

To walk the entire 585-mile route around Ulster would take weeks. But a good taster is the Causeway Coast Way in Antrim, one of the three coastal sections. Its 33 miles offer dramatic views of the honeycomb columns of the Giants’ Causeway, a pile of basalt columns formed between 50 and 60 million years ago, and a walk across the remarkable Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge to the tiny island of Carrick. First erected by salmon fishermen in 1755, the 30m-high bridge offers panoramic views of the country’s landscape. Expect to see dramatic, Insta-worthy sunsets over the rocks.

The forests, mountains and moorlands around Northern Ireland formed the scenic backdrops for *Game of Thrones* ’ most memorable moments. It’s here in Tollymore Forest Park – better known as the Haunted Forest – on the outskirts of Newcastle where the White Walkers began their march into the realm of men. If Game Of Thrones is not your calling, then the ancient redwoods as well as Gothic stone arches – the remnants of an 18th-century estate – across the 600 hectares of woodland might persuade you to drop by.

## Davagh Dark Sky Observatory

Criss-crossed with hedgerows, soft valleys and heather-clad hills with sweeping views, the Sperrin Mountains, in mid-Ulster, could have been conjured up from the pages of a CS Lewis novel (Lewis is a Belfast native, FYI). By day, you will encounter all kinds of native animal species (Irish hares, red grouse, peregrine falcons, foxes). By night, however, get a front-row seat into the depths of the universe at the OM Dark Sky Park and Observatory, a £1.25m facility giving guests an unrivalled look at the night sky in one of Ireland’s only accredited international dark sky parks. Scheduled to open in April, but delayed by the pandemic until autumn, it promises to offer a spectacular voyage through the solar system.

The cliff-face path at Islandmagee is perhaps the crown jewel of the mid and east Antrim borough, and its suspension bridge, tunnels and pathways bring walkers up close and personal with the spectacular coastline and its inhabitants. Take a step back in time and explore each section of the restored 19th-century pathway, from “The Aquarium”, which is the perfect chance to spot some of the many species of fish that live in these waters, to “Gordon’s Leap”, a striking suspension bridge.

## Castlewellan Castle, Castlewellan Forest Park, County Down

Should you find yourself in Northern Ireland during the balmy months of August or September, then dining al fresco is essential. Nestled at the foot of the scenic Mourne Mountains, Castlewellan Castle, designed by the architect William Burn and built between 1856 and 1858, with its picturesque granite facade and slender round tower and turret, will provide a stylish backdrop for a light lunch of locally sourced black pudding and apple salad. After your picnic, walk to the highest points of the grounds for spectacular views across Dundrum Bay to the Isle of Man.

## Loughside cottage, County Fermanagh

No need for a grainy, vintage-inspired Instagram filter here! Sleeping up to five people, [Geaglum](https://www.underthethatch.co.uk/rci), located in the vicinity of Upper Lough Erne, the lakelands of Fermanagh, is a picture-postcard thatched home steeped in history – and it comes with 1950s-style interiors drenched in nostalgia. Walk the short distance to nearby Pebble Beach to see early Celtic archeology and rent a rowboat to discover the maze of waterways, which are home to an archipelago of some 150 islets.

## Whiterocks Beach, Coleraine

Just off Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coastal Route, Whiterocks Beach is ideal for both [surfing](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/surfing-for-beginners) and horseback riding. Its limestone cliffs are justifiably famous, too. Explore the hidden caves and try to spot as many of the sweetly-named formations as possible, from the Wishing Arch to the Lion’s Paw.

## Marble Arch Caves, Fermanagh

Explore the Fermanagh landscape from a completely unique (underground) perspective at the Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark, Fermanagh. A celebrated UNESCO site, the cave shows off 895 million years of Earth’s history throughout a 75-minute subterranean boat ride that leads to a mile-long guided walk through and out of the cave. Pro tip: turn your camera flash on.

## Witness The Northern Lights

If you thought you could only see the Northern Lights from Iceland or Antarctica, then think again. Every year people make their way along the five mile coastline between Northern Ireland’s Giant’s Causeway and Dunluce Castle, hoping for the chance to witness the spectacular light show.
