> One of these patterns is ‘self- regulation’ – the ability to monitor and control a system’s behaviour and maintain stable conditions within a changing environment. Self-regulating systems can be found everywhere, including the physiological systems of our bodies (it’s what keeps body temperature stable), and in the global climate (it’s what keeps our weather within the limits that allow us to thrive)  

Ecosystems are self-regulating
They’re resistant to change
