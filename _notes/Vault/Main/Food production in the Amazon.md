Nutrient rich and stable soil described above facilitates the growing of food as another benefit provided by the Amazons natural ecosystems. The Kayapo tribe provide an example of a local Indigenous tribe that cultivate diverse crops in the Amazon (CITATION). The Kayapo plant crops in nutrient rich soil provided by the carbon cycle as mentioned earlier. After a number of years the small areas of land used loses its nutrients and therefore its ability to grow food. When land becomes exhausted, crops are rotated to different land areas which provides a sustainable way of living. The traditional methods used by the Kayapo provide sustenance to their people and form an important part of their cultural identity. Alternative commercial farming methods use land in the Amazonian for large scale food production. For example, one of the main exports from Brazil is soya beans which supplies the global animal feed market. Animals that are fed soya bean products, such as cattle are then consumed by people. The majority of beef produced in Brazil is for domestic consumption. Even so, Brazil exports more beef to the rest of the world than any other country (CITATION-132). However, global demand for beef is also the main driver of deforestation in the Amazon (CITATION-139).  (CITATION-139) suggests that soya beans cultivated in Brazil could satisfy global protein demands as an alternative to beef. For soya to satisfy global protein requirements, land use for soya farming would need to increase from current levels of 22 million hectares (ha) to 140 million ha. 

 that rely on heavy machinery and chemicals for pesticides and fertiliser leave the land nutrient poor. The land is eventually used for cultivating monoculture crops like soya beans. 
 
However, another significant benefit of the Amazons natural ecosystems is the food it is able to produce for export.  Therefore, the effects of depleted river systems in the Amazon could also be felt globally by the countries that depend on exports from Amazon countries.  


## Notes
#### Global food demands

> Perversely, pressure to grow soya in the Amazonian states may have increased because of the demand from environmentalists in Europe for GM-free soya  

A ban in Europe on GM soya because of links to BSE meant that soya is imported from the Amazon. Importing soya from the Amazon obviously has a whol host of complex problems associated with it.

> Soya cultivation could potentially make a major contribution to our global food needs if everybody derived their protein directly from soya beans. It has been estimated that one hectare of soya may produce enough protein to supply the needs of approximately 50 people. A rough calculation suggests that 140 million hectares would be needed just to grow this protein. (If one hectare produces sufficient protein for 50 people, then the global population of 7 billion people require 7 billion/50 = 140 million hectares.) This compares with the 22 million hectares currently being farmed for soya bean in Brazil. The new area would represent about one-sixth of the area of Brazil, so assuming that this area was suitable for growing soya beans it is theoretically possible for Brazil to meet the world’s protein needs. At the moment, most of the soya grown in the Amazon is supplied to animals to provide food for humans, which feeds far fewer of us

> based on opening small temporary plots of land in forests, and planting these with species that had different rates of maturity – from rapidly cropping maize to banana and fruit trees that would take more than two years before producing. Indigenous communities also relied extensively on harvesting nuts and fruit from the wider forest, and on fishing and hunting. Thus, their animal protein was not derived from domesticated animals, but from wild animals. It is interesting to note that the intentional and unintentional planting of fruit and palm trees also favoured many wild animal species, such as pigs and deer, which take advantage of the active and abandoned plots to do their own foraging. On top of the charcoal left behind by the rotational farming, the accumulation of bones and fish scales near human settlements also fertilised the soil, thus contributing to the vigorous re-growth of the forest. So, when the European colonisers arrived, what they saw as ‘wild forest’ may in fact have been highly managed and productive ‘agroforests’.
