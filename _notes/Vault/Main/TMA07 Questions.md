## Question 1
**This question carries 95% of the marks for this assignment.**

**Write a report for an authority of a city or town making the case for sustainable transport. Your report should explain why sustainable transport is important and give recommendations to achieve a more sustainable transport system in your chosen city or town.**

Your report must have a title and the following section headings: ‘Introduction’, ‘Making the case’, ‘Proposal’ and ‘Conclusion’.

The advice on answering the question gives more detail about the content of each section.

_(Question 1 has a word limit of 2000 words. There are word count guidelines for each section of your report in Table 1. These are guidelines only and it is acceptable if some sections are slightly shorter or longer, provided that the overall word limit is 2000 words. Include the total word count at the end of your report._ _If you exceed the_ _total word limit by more than 10%, you could lose up to 3 marks. For guidance on what is included in the word limit, see the [U116 Assessment Guide](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/olink.php?id=1714824&targetdoc=Assessment+guide&targetptr=1.7))_.

### Advice on answering Question 1

Question 1 has been set so that you can demonstrate your understanding of _Block 6: Cities and towns_ and your skills in writing a report using your own words. In compiling your report, you should draw mainly on ideas, evidence and examples from Block 6. You will also need to do a small amount of research on your chosen city or town. 

You should identify the sources of information that you have drawn upon using in-text citations and a reference list. 

You can choose any existing city or town that you wish. It can be one that you are familiar with or one that you have read about. Your advice can apply to part or all of your chosen city or town. The focus is on urban communities so choosing a rural area would not be appropriate.

A report is written to present findings or recommendations to a specific audience. When you are writing your report, it is important to remember who your audience is so that you write in a way that helps their understanding and that has direct relevance for them. In this case, your audience will be the authority (i.e. the appropriate elected body for your chosen city or town). Members of the authority are drawn mainly from the local community. It is expected that most of them will have no particular expertise regarding environmental issues. Although they are not experts, they are in a position to make critical environmental decisions on behalf of the local citizens.

#### Planning and writing a report: relevant module materials

You might find it helpful to revisit the relevant module material on planning and writing a report.

[Block 3 Part 1, Section 6](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/olink.php?id=1714824&targetdoc=Sections+2%2C+5+and+6+%28all+online%29&targetptr=3) (online) introduced you to reports and how to write them.

TMA 04 Question 1 (online) also offered advice on report writing. You may also find it helpful to revisit your tutor’s feedback on this assignment.

Remember that a good report has a structure that is fairly rigid. It should have a title and be written in sections, with a heading for each section, and each section should perform a specific task. For this question, the headings for the ‘main body’ of your report are provided for you - further guidance for each section is given below. You can use figures and images to illustrate your answer, but it is not essential.

Your TMA07 file must be no larger than 10MB. If you use images or figures this can increase the size of your file, and if it is larger than 10 MB it will not be accepted by the electronic system. For information on how to check and reduce your file size, see the OU booklet [Information for students submitting examinable work electronically](https://help.open.ac.uk/students/_data/documents/assessment/online-ema-guidelines.pdf).

In addition to the marks allocated for each section of the report, there are marks available for the quality of presentation - this includes the structure, clarity and coherence of your writing, and appropriate use of in-text citations and references (see below).

Your report should have a title and four sections with headings plus references as follows:

**_Title_**

This should be clear, brief and relevant to the content of the report. It should help the reader to see at a glance what the report is about and who it is for.

**(3 marks)**

**_Introduction_**

You need to identify your chosen city or town and explain the purpose of the report for the authority. You should briefly explain what is meant by sustainable transport (reflecting the Block 6 approach, which includes factors such as liveability, emissions and local air pollution). You should also outline how the report is organised.

**(10 marks)** 

**_Making the case_** 

In this section you should make the case for developing a more sustainable transport system in your chosen city or town and address the following points to develop your case:

-   Present background information on urban sustainability and explain why more sustainable transport systems should be developed in cities and towns generally. 
    
    **(10 marks)**
    
-   Include a brief description of your chosen city or town such as location, population and its transport system. 
    
    **(8 marks)**
    
-   Explain why the authority should play an important role in developing a more sustainable transport system in your chosen city or town. 
    
    **(8 marks)** 
    

**(26 marks)** 

**_Proposal_** 

A good proposal will have three or four well-described recommendations to achieve a more sustainable transport system and will explain how the recommendations can be put into action. Recommendations should include, and clearly identify, both technical and social/behavioural changes. Answers that give long lists or just one recommendation are likely to score less well.

In your proposal, make sure that you address the following:

-   Describe the main features of your proposal including your recommendations. 
    
    **(12 marks)**
    
-   Explain how your proposal should be put into action. Consider what actions might be taken by the city or town authority to whom your report is addressed and also by the individual (the ‘I’), the community or neighbourhood (the ‘we’) and other relevant agencies (the ‘they’) and beyond. 
    
    **(14 marks)**
    
-   What, in general, are the anticipated benefits of your proposal, and what are the possible disadvantages? 
    
    **(10 marks)**
    

**(36 marks)**

**_Conclusion_**

You should end your report with a brief conclusion that summarises the main points of your case and your proposal, including your recommendations. Note that a conclusion is _not_ the place to introduce new material.

**(10 marks)**

**_References_**

You should include in-text citations in your work and a reference list at the end of your report for your sources. For guidance on in-text citations and references see ‘Revisiting referencing’ in [Block 4, Part 3, Section 5 (online, week 21)](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/olink.php?id=1714824&targetdoc=Section+5+%28all+online%29&targetptr=1.5) and the [U116 Assessment Guide](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/olink.php?id=1714824&targetdoc=Assessment+guide).

**_Presentation_**

Marks will be awarded for the quality of presentation, which includes structure, clarity, coherence, conciseness and appropriate use of in-text citations and references. Remember to include the total word count at the end of your report. [](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/olink.php?id=1714824&targetdoc=Assessment+guide)

**(10 marks)**

## Question 2
**This question carries 5% of the marks for this assignment.**

Now that you have completed the module, this question asks you to reflect on your perception of environmental issues.

What do you think are the most pressing environmental concerns for the next 10 years? Explain whether your views have changed since you answered TMA 01 Question 1 at the start of the module, and why.

**(5 marks)**

_(Question 2 has a word limit of 200 words. Include a word count at the end of your answer.)_
