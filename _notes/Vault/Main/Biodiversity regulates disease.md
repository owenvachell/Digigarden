A potential problem with expanding soya bean cultivation is that monoculture crops like soya reduce the Amazons natural ability to regulate diseases. Biodiversity in the Amazons is another benefit provided by the natural ecosystem of the rainforest. Research has shown that “Deforested areas were shown to have up to a 300-fold increase in the risk of malaria infection, compared to areas of protected forest” ([CITATION](highlights://Amazon%20Life#page=112)). The presence of predators in diverse food webs keeps populations of disease carrying pests under control. Deforestation removes  natural habitats where predators live. Destruction of predators habitats reduces their populations in deforested areas, allowing disease carrying pests populations to grow. The regulation of diseases in the Amazon could be seen as a local benefit. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that controlling diseases is of global importance.

## Notes
  [Page 112](highlights://Amazon%20Life#page=112) 
> Rainforests may provide another valuable ecosystem service, reducing the risk of infectious disease by controlling the populations of disease vectors such as mosquitoes and rats by sustaining healthy populations of pest predators, such as bats and snakes  

> Deforestation also reduces predators by, for example, removing tree roosting sites for bats, and facilitating the movement and migration of the adult mosquito (mosquitoes can’t fly very high, so removing vegetation gives them a much easier passage through the landscape). Research carried out in the Amazon has shown that the risk of catching malaria rose sharply during the late 1980s and 1990s as a result, in part, to deforestation (Aramburu Guarda et al., 1999; Vittor et al., 2006). Deforested areas were shown to have up to a 300-fold increase in the risk of malaria infection, compared to areas of protected forest. Deforestation has also been shown to increase other disease risks by affecting, for example, the availability of clean, fresh water and increasing the probability of waterborne diseases, such as diarrhoea induced by bacteria developing in stagnant pools (Patz et al., 2005). The increase in forest fires associated with deforestation has also resulted in a spike in respiratory diseases.
