The water cycle starts with evaporation caused by heat from the sun. Most evaporation comes from the Ocean. Winds move the water vapour produced by evaporation and potentially forms clouds. Precipitation from clouds formed by water vapour falls onto the land which runs off into streams and rivers. Water collected by streams and rivers from the land flows into the sea.
