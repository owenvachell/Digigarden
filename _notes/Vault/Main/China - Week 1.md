## What are the pros and cons of capitalism and communism
China had a more equal society under communism but higher levels of poverty. When adopting certain capitalist principles, it raised large numbers of its population out of poverty but widened inequality

> Between 1981 and 2010, China pulled 680 million people out of poverty, which means that whereas in 1980 as many as 84% of the population lived in poverty, in 2010 this figure was 10%  

Benefits from Chinas economic growth has been shared with its people

## Does industrialisation result in a growing economy?

> So does the positive correlation between percentage share of industry and income per person show that industrialisation causes an increase in economic output? The answer, unfortunately, is that it is not so simple. A correlation indicates that there is an association between two variables, for example GDP per capita and share of industry, but does not demonstrate that one is the cause of the other. The correlation could be down to chance, or it could be that growth in income causes industrialisation. Or, as is often the case, it could be that both are responding to a third factor, such as global trade
