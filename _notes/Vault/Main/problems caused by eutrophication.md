> excessive richness of nutrients in a lake or other body of water, frequently due to run-off from the land, which causes a dense growth of plant life.  

* Excessive algae growth
	* prevents sunlight from penetrating the waters surface
* Physical blockages from larger plants
* Dying plants as a result of deoxygenation caused by decay

An example in the Nile basin is water hyacinth, a fast growing invasive species that can clog waterways, preventing boats passing through (economic impact).
