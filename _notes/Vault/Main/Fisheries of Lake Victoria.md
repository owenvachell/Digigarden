Unintended consequences of human intervention in the ecosystem. Further explores links between hydrological and socio-economic links in water systems. 

## Introducing Lake Victoria Fisheries
Second largest lake in the world (after Lake Superior) with densely populated coastline.

### Stakeholders
- Countries
	- Kenya
	- Tanzania
	- Uganda
- Organisations
	- Lake Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC)
		- Co-ordinates sustainable, regional development
	- Lake Victoria Fisheries Organisation (LVFO)
		- Manages the fisheries

### History
Traditionally used for subsistence fishing/farming that supplied the riparian population. Artisinal methods employed by local fisherman provided approximately **100,000 tonnes** of fish per year up until and including the 1970’s.

Over 500 endemic fish species existed in Lake Victoria until the introduction of Nile Perch, a non-indigenous and predatory species.

**Endemic**: found only in a specific location and nowhere else. something that’s endemic is also indigenous. Something that is indigenous is not necessarily endemic.

## Changing Bio-diversity
Lake Victoria is less than a million years old and has a high amount of bio-diversity. This is thought to be due to the periods of drying that isolated species, and then re-introduced them when the Lake re-filled.

### Interventions and tensions
Nile Perch yielded larger fillets than the endemic species and were introduced to Lake Victoria to meet demands of the British colonial government in Uganda. 

## Nile Perch
What makes them good predators?
- Muscular body means that it’s strong
- Paddle like tail allows it to rapidly accelerate
- Large mouth means it can capture large quantities easily
- Large eyes help it to see prey easier

### Ecological Transformation
Introduction of Nile Perch lead to booming, commercial fishing industry 

Nile Perch introduced to Lake Victoria had a devastating impact on bio-diversity in the region. 


The growth in the fishing industry meant that more people were visiting Lake Victoria. A side-effect of increased human activity on the Lake is increased pollution potential. This is because of greater demands on local water systems creating more wastewater. Increased agricultural demands also increase nutrient run off. These are all causes of different pollution types such as:
	- eutrophication
	- deoxygenation
	- increased turbidity
	- reduced light penetration

Eutrophication caused a spread of water hyacinth. Due to their size, water hyacinth blocked out more light that is needed by sub-surface species for photosynthesis. Oxygen levels in the water decrease because of less photosynthesis. Water hyacinth also disturbed shoreline fish spawning habitats, such as haplochromine. The decline of haplochromine species exacerbated deoxygenation and light reduction because these fish eat phytoplankton and algae, which benefits water quality.

### Haplochromine crash
Haplochromine are sensitive to water quality degradation. Biodiversity loss removed the lakes ability to recover from change.


Note not only the decline in numbers of species, but also the decline in the total groups of species.

### What happened next?
Despite a decline in haplochromine, the amount of fish being caught in Lake Victoria increased.


**Note**: the above graph indicates *mass* of fish caught, not number of fish. Remember that Nile Perch are significantly larger fish. Similarly, when fish are being removed that have not reached maturity, this will eventually lead to population decline. If mass continues to increase or remains the same, but individual size decreases, this would indicate an increase in the number of fish being caught.

Expanding commercial fishing trade on Lake Victoria caused an increase in fishing effort (the number of boats and fisherman on the water). Modern fishing equipment has grown in effectiveness for catching fish. The level of fish being removed from Lake Victoria is arguably unsustainable. 

The reappearance of haplochromine fish being caught would indicate a decline in the predatory Nile Perch. Bad news for the commercial fishing trade.

## Social Transformation
Looking at intended and unintended consequences from a socio-economic perspective.

### Fishing for the global market
The Lake Bounty video indicates how the local fishing economy has changed song the introduction of Nile Perch to Lake Victoria. The high food standards on display suggest that fish are processed at Lake Bounty for a global market. Although wealth from the local fishing trade is not distributed evenly.

Interestingly, both men and women are emptied in processing of fish, a task that was previously allocated to women while men caught the fish.

### Fishing for local markets
While large quantities of fish are removed from Lake Victoria and sold to a global market, not much is left behind for local populations.

### Local consequences from the global market

* 25 years ago most fish was eaten locally; now, exports go to Europe, Japan, the USA.
* Fish resources are threatened by strong demand of international markets for Nile perch.
* Changes in distribution of labour: in the 1970s, 50 000 fishermen and tens of thousands of women in small-scale fish processing and trade; men fished, women processed, dried and sold.
* 100 000 tonnes caught annually.
* Basis of many livelihoods; millions of people consumed fish from the lake.
* 1980s saw major change, explosive demand from international markets.
* Foreign investors established fish export factories.
* Fish export factories processing one species, Nile perch, which was introduced in 1950s by GB, former colonial ruler.
* In 10 years, total catch increased from 100 000 to 500 000 tonnes per year.
* Changes in organisation: before, fisheries were supplying the local and regional markets; now, modernised and integrated into global market.
* Since 1990, about 500 000 tonnes per year caught; 25% of freshwater catch of the entire continent.
* Shift to more expensive fishing technology; few now own their own boats – some work as crew on factory boats.
* Modern industry has financial support from multilateral development banks and aid agencies.
* Less fish available for locals.
* Mechanised boats destroy traditional fishing nets, use illegal equipment, and encroach on spawning areas, which are protected by local regulations for protection and reproduction of species.
* Fish is most important source of animal protein, especially for poor who cannot afford meat.
* 1980s saw big change: within ten years there were 35 export factories around the lake.
* Nile perch represents 50–60% of the total catch from Lake Victoria (LV).
* Several 100 000 tonnes of fish per year exported to western markets, from a continent that needs proteins.
* Even though new jobs created in the factories, there are net job losses: 6-8 jobs lost in the traditional fisheries sector for each modern factory processing job created.
* Threat to food security and employment.
* Both owners and fishers want to see more control of fishing, due to concerns about collapse of the fish stocks.
* Another fish, *omena* – caught at night with lights; sold to women; dried on the beach; rich in protein; 30-35% of total catch.
* Commercial value of *omena* has increased, and now it is exported to East African factories to be made into fishmeal.
* By 2000, only 1/3 of *omena* caught was eaten by humans; most is fed to animals, especially chickens.
* This source of animal protein is no longer as readily available to the poor people living around the lake.
* Change in value made processing of *omena* for animal feed a good economic prospect because it was cheaper than importing fishmeal.
* *Omena* is an excellent source of protein and other essential dietary requirements.
* The needs of industry are emerging as being stronger than the nutritional needs of the local population.
* Question arising: should we feed people or animals, first? Child before the chicken?
* Despite 5 times more fish being caught than 25 years ago, local consumption of fish has reduced.
* Diseases and malnutrition caused by lack of animal proteins.
* Aid agencies and development banks accused of not showing interest in the negative consequences for the local population of exporting fish for consumption in wealthy countries and for animal feed production.
* UNICEF now distributing vitamins and iron tablets.
* There is an argument that people ought to benefit from the fish that are geographically near them, particularly because it is their only source of protein.
* It is unfair that fish is now too expensive for them.
* One factory earns 20–30 million US$ per year in foreign exchange but little is reinvested.
* Living conditions have deteriorated after LV’s integration into the global economy.
* Factories are contributing to unemployment; 200 employed in factory but could be 5000 more jobs without it.
* 35 fish export companies make many 100 million US$ each year but profit remains abroad.
* Current utilisation of fisheries resources is unsustainable.
* Factories only have a short-term perspective: only want to regain investment and make quick profit.
* Warning of unregulated management leading to decline in fish stocks.
* Beneficiaries: factory owners and small African elite.
* Losers: millions of poor people in East Africa.
* There is risk: factories will leave if/when the lake is empty.

#### Intended consequences
- Fishing industry expansion
- Local employment opportunities

#### Unintended Consequences
- Booming industry resulted in overfishing and habitat for spawning fish species. Larger companies and factories are likely to move on because of the reducing opportunities in the size of the fish catch. When the larger companies move away, local people that worked there will inevitably lose their jobs. A population that has grown due to the increased opportunities created by the fishing industry will be left without sufficient supply of a vital source of animal protein, resulting in malnutrition. 
- Big business reduced share of catch for local people and therefore loss of livelihood
- Omena is a source of animal protein that local people depended on. It is now sold as animal meat instead because it is more profitable. This removes another source of animal protein.

### Fish out, people in
- Fishing industry valued at $650 million in 2007
- 4 million people depend on it
- Opportunities created by the Lake Victoria fisheries has seen higher than average population growth compared with the rest of Africa. This could be positive (economic growth) or negative (increased social and civil infrastructure demands).
	- Means a shift away from traditional riparian economy
	- Loss of opportunities for women with redistribution of low paid labour
	- Infrastructure unable to keep up with growth meaning basic utilities are unavailable, such as schools, medical care or housing.
		- Fisherman living in huts provided by fishing companies
		- Poor health standards resulting in HIV/AIDS

Similarities in the above graphs:
- they both show population growth

Differences in the above graphs:
- The maps provide context with regards to the distribution of population growth.
- The bar graphs show how significant the population growth is compared with the rest of Africa, indicating that it is potentially an outlier.

## Role of women
Means of income for women are becoming increasingly harder for women because of the commercial Lake Victoria fishing trade. Many have been left with only half an income because of deaths to their husbands. A major cause of death among fisherman was the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS during the population boom. This exacerbated existing hazardous fishing conditions including storm, crocodiles and pirates.

To make up for the loss of income, women have had to resort to sexual favours, exposing themselves to risk of HIV/AIDS. But women were left with very little choice if they are to make a life for themselves and provide for their families.

There are situations where women are prospering in the traditionally male roles. For example, [Mama Sylvia](https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=1681825&section=7.2) has become the prosperous owner of a fishery landing site on Lake Victoria. However, her successful business is also an example of how larger fishing companies control opportunity in the Lake Victoria fisheries.

## Management and regulations
There are rule s in place to regulate the Lake Victoria fisheries that include net size and bans on trawlers, which would flout the rules when fishing in area to which they did not belong.

### Beach Management Units
Beach Management Units (BMUs) are a community based, ‘bottom-up’ approach to surveillance of the Lake Victoria fisheries and regulation enforcement. Policing helps to make the fisheries more sustainable. However, BMUs require a buy in from all stakeholders if they are to be successful. Poorer local people will a lack of opportunity may feel they have no choice but to ignore the rules if they are to make a life for themselves and their families.

### Enforcing the rules
Fisheries processing factory inspections helps to enforce the rules but also results in the sale of undersized fish to informal markets.

Confiscation of illegal fishing equipments, like nets removes opportunities for people to make a sustainable living or provide for their families. However, it is necessary for the long-term sustainability of Lake Victoria’s fisheries.

## Geopolitical conflict
Conflict is another example of an unintended consequence from introducing Nile Perch to Lake Victoria. The intended boom in the fisheries has lead to population and industry growth on Migingo Island, which Uganda and Kenya are in disputes over ownership. The island is home to competing interest on either side in terms of commercial opportunities for scarce natural resources which are subject to taxation. Attractive commercial opportunities become a target for corrupt officials and pirates.

> ‘There is not an inevitability to conflict […] But what we have to acknowledge is that, in an era with more and more people and an ever higher consumption footprint, the scarcity of natural resources can amplify conflict’ (reported in McGuffin, 2009)  
>   
> - Achim Steiner, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme  

Island residents don’t recognise the conflict. Instead, the conflict is seen on an official and state level.

### Uncertain future
System like the BMUs that are enforced upon the society through multilateral agreements reinforces local hierarchies. They help the wealthier controllers of the fisheries to continue getting rich while the poor people that drive the economy don’t benefit at all. Fear of armed conflict is seeing people leave the island en masse, which means that everyone loses.
