### Notes
Engaging communities with a ‘bottom-up’ approach is much more likely to get the buy in required from all stakeholders for successful conservation efforts. After all, it is the local people who live on the frontline of conservation, so they should be able to benefit most from it.

Local people that depend on area should be considered during conservation efforts. For example, farmers need land to earn a living. Ignoring the needs of these people can put them into poverty.

::The western attitude to conservation may only be concerned with their own perception of what value there is in the wildlife, such as intrinsic value mentioned above. But to local people there may be a much more meaningful, instrumental value.::

Conservation efforts are likely to fail (as Fortress Conservation did) if there is a lack of consideration for the above mentioned two points. Simply keeping ALL people out is not always the answer

### Valuing wildlife
Ecosystems are a human-centric concept. ::Wildlife has an instrumental value to humans as part of the ecosystem::. They either sustain human life or provide cultural significance.

However, ::wildlife has an intrinsic value:: too (less tangible) - it’s existence for its own sake.

Wildlife economic value:
- food
- medicine
- timber
- tourism

It’s possible for those that feel financial gain to work in tandem with conservation efforts. 

**Ecotourism**:
- transforming local and national economies
- alleviating poverty
- sustains well-being of local people (paraphrase this)
- conserves the environment

### Answer to TMA04 Q4

local people who’s lives are connected to the wildlife. . An example of western approaches is ‘Fortress Conservation’, which aimed to keep people out of the protected area entirely. ICD aims to acknowledge the instrumental value of wildlife to the people living in conservation areas. Also, local people are able to offer valuable knowledge of the area which can be key to the success of conservation efforts. Such

The integrated conservation development (ICD) approach is a strategy to put people that live locally to conservation regions at the centre of efforts to protect the areas ecology. ICD aims to engage local communities and help them benefit from conservation. In addition, ICD seeks to tap into valuable local knowledge of conservation areas. By engaging communities the ICD approach is much more likely to get the buy in required from all stakeholders for successful conservation efforts.
