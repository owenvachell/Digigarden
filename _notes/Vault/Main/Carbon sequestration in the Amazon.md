Tropical rainforests like that of the Amazon basin are capable of storing disproportionately more carbon per km2 than any other biome ([CITATION](highlights://Amazon%20Life#page=106)). For example, ([CITATION](highlights://Amazon%20Life#page=95)) highlights that “the Amazon rainforest biome is able to absorb more than four times the UK’s carbon emissions”. The ability to store large amounts of carbon over long periods of time is referred to as carbon sequestration. Carbon is able to remain in the Amazon by moving between its diverse species in a process called the carbon cycle. First, plants and trees absorb carbon atoms from carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Carbon atoms combine with water and sunlight to form glucose in the process of photosynthesis. Energy from glucose metabolises to stimulate new growth in the plant or tree, which releases CO2. Animals referred to as herbivores or primary consumers absorb some of the carbon stored in the plants by eating the leaves. Organic matter from animal excretion or decomposing dead animals further stores carbon in the ground of the rainforest, creating nutrient rich soil. The carbon cycle in the Amazon is of vital importance to the global climate. Continued deforestation could deplete vital resources needed for the Amazons carbon cycle. The potential consequence of depletion to the Amazons natural ability to store carbon could mean rising levels of carbon stored in the earth’s atmosphere. Rising levels of carbon stored in the atmosphere lead to climate change which has the potential for devastating impacts across the world.

of the Amazons natural ecosystems  Acting as a reservoir for carbon the Amazon locks away carbon that could potentially be stored in the earth’s atmosphere. 

 Amazon rainforest and its natural ecosystems play a vital role in the long term storage of vast amounts of carbon, also known as carbon sequestration. 

## Notes
  [Page 95](highlights://Amazon%20Life#page=95) 
> In normal years, the Amazon rainforest biome absorbs more carbon than it emits, removing between 0.42 and 0.65 Gt of carbon from the atmosphere (Pan et al., 2011; Phillips et al., 2009). As a comparison, the UK emitted 0.12 Gt of carbon in 2014 (the figure is rounded up to 2 decimal places) (DECC, 2015). Thus, in an average year, the Amazon rainforest biome is able to absorb more than four times the UK’s carbon emissions. This ability to absorb and accumulate carbon is known as ‘carbon sequestration

> Photosynthesis occurs in most plants and a few other specialised organisms and involves carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and water being combined to make glucose using light energy from the Sun. The glucose molecules are chemically bound together as starch and stored in parts of the plant such as the leaves and roots. Plants lose this carbon in three ways. As you will recall from Block 1, carbon can be lost due to respiration by the plant itself. This process involves glucose molecules being split to release energy and producing carbon dioxide and water – the opposite chemical reaction to photosynthesis. This method of respiration is found in most living organisms. The resultant energy is used to drive a whole set of different chemical reactions, collectively referred to as metabolism. Second, the carbon in a plant can also be consumed when alive  

Explain that this is through the process of photosynthesis. Think about your audience.

#### Consequences of deforestation on carbon sequestration in the Amazon
The amazon is [NOT a carbon sink](highlights://Amazon%20Life#page=101). It’s more like a bank. But removing the trees needed for the amazon to continue in it’s role as this carbon bank, means less carbon is absorbed and therefore stored in the atmosphere instead
