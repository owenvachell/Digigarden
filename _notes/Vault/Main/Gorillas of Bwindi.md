## Wildlife conservation
> Protection of wild plants and animals and their habitats  

Protection - from *us*
And their habitats - encompasses ALL species

Alternative definition:
> planned management of natural resources to prevent exploitation, destruction or neglect, or the sustainable use and management of natural resources.  

### Valuing wildlife
Ecosystems are a human-centric concept. Wildlife has an instrumental value to humans as part of the ecosystem. They either sustain human life or provide cultural significance.

However, wildlife has an intrinsic value too (less tangible) - it’s existence for its own sake.

Wildlife economic value:
- food
- medicine
- timber
- tourism

It’s possible for those that feel financial gain to work in tandem with conservation efforts. 

**Ecotourism**:
> ‘responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being of the local people, and involves interpretation and education’ (TIES, 2015)  

Ecotourism benefits:
- transforming local and national economies
- alleviating poverty

### Need for conservation
- Increasing extinction rates, particularly vertebrate animals 
	- climate change
	- anthropogenic impact
		- destruction of habitats
			- Growing populations encroaching on animals space
		- climate change!

### International level
Stakeholders:
- International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
	- Global organisation that works with governments on supporting biodiversity. Classifies endangered species in accordance with its ‘red list’
- Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
	- international agreement between governments to ensure trade doesn’t threaten survival of species
- Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
	- Convention that identified biodiversity loss as one of the most import global contemporary issues.

## Conservation approaches
### Fortress conservation
Local people that depend on area should be considered during conservation efforts. For example, farmers need land to earn a living. Ignoring the needs of these people can put them into poverty.

The western attitude to conservation may only be concerned with their own perception of what value there is in the wildlife, such as intrinsic value mentioned above. But to local people there may be a much more meaningful, instrumental value.

Conservation efforts are likely to fail (as Fortress Conservation did) if there is a lack of consideration for the above mentioned two points. Simply keeping ALL people out is not always the answer

### Integrated conservation and Development (ICD)
Engaging communities with a ‘bottom-up’ approach is much more likely to get the buy in required from all stakeholders for successful conservation efforts. After all, it is the local people who live on the frontline of conservation, so they should be able to benefit most from it.

## Bwindi Impenetrable National Park
Gets the name from tangled ferns and vines.
Immensely diverse, with many endemic species:
- 1000 species of flowering plants
- 120 mammals
- 348 birds
- 27 amphibians
- > 220 butterfly species
(TEAM Network, 2016)

Approx. Half the worlds population of mountain gorillas live in Bwindi

Ecotourism is a good way to manage sustainable access to wildlife while simultaneously providing incomes to local people employed within the ecotourism industry both directly and indirectly (gift shops).

## People of Bwindi
There are large demands on the land with growing surrounding population and the infrastructure required to support it (cultivation).

Crops:
- Bananas
- sorghum
- sweet potatoes 
- millet and Irish potatoes
- tea/coffee

The Batwa people are a forest-dwelling tribe. Bwindi carries significant cultural value to the Batwa people who depend on the wildlife, fruit and other food it produces.
