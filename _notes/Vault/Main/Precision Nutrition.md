## Who's on my team?
Staying: **Determined dude**
The man that, last week, was tackling challenging mountain ascents in the heaving wind and rain but didn't give up because he was determined to reach the top. Reframing this determination in a way that applies to reaching (what I see as) peak nutrition and fitness will help me reach my PN goals.

Going: **OCPD turned cheater**
> **OCPD** Whole personality turned into an obsessive compulsion about every last detail. Highly stressed, highly critical, self-torturing and highly abusive towards myself with my judgement that _no effort is good enough_. Distorted view of myself and others. I've given up on this crazy world. I use knowledge as privilege. I'm angry and controlling.

> **Cheater** I fudge my own goals. One bad meal turns into a bad day, then I become strict for several days to make up for the bad. This is my yo-yo cycle. I celebrate success with bad food, drink, bad relationships. I don't quite buy that I'm capable of sustaining long-term wellness. I'm constantly in extreme diet mode followed by reckless abandon of any self-care. Yo-yo cycles can last a couple days or up to a few month. Maintenance doesn't exist. I'm exhausted.

I'm critical and judgemental towards myself but when things aren't going to plan, it's easy for me to grab something to eat that offers me no nutritional value or to just skip a workout because I feel bad about not being on course with my goals so I might as well not bother.
