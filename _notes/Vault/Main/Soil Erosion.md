Soil erosion is a source of particulate material that gets washed into rivers by rain.

Factors that contribute to soil erosion are:
* Rainfall intensity
* Slope of the land
* Presence and type of vegetation

Heavy rain combined with bare soil, both of which are present in the Nile basin, heavily impact soil erosion which affects agriculture and the economy.
