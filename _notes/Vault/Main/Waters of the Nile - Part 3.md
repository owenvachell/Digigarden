### Nile Ownership


> "In many parts of the world, ownership of river water is determined by ownership of the river banks" ([Furniss :134](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=15))

> "The Nile Waters Agreement of 1929, made between the Egyptian Government and the British High Commissioner representing Sudan, gave Egypt the right to use almost all the Nile's water, apart from a tiny allocation to Sudan. Thefigures, based on contemporary estimates offlow, were 48 km3 (cubic kilometres) annually to Egypt, 4 km3 to Sudan, and the remaining 32 km3 toflow to the sea" ([Furniss :135](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=16))

### Nile conflicts

> "Although there was no war, Egypt used other means to protect its interests by covert destabilisation of the upstream countries (Kagwanja, 2007). For example, at various times Egypt gavefinancial and military support to Eritreansfighting against the Ethiopian Government and also to the Somalis fighting against Kenya. As noted above, internal unrest in Ethiopia and the other upstream countries, coupled with lack of funds, prevented their plans for major water projects from coming to fruition" ([Furniss :137](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=18))

#### Egyptian dominance on the Nile

> "In other words, Egypt was allowed complete control over any potential use of the Nile waters by the upstream countries. Although many objections have since been raised by the countries of the upper Nile, this agreement has never been revoked, so theoretically Egypt still'owns' the water thatflows out of Lake Victoria or Lake Tana and can veto its use by any upstream country" ([Furniss :135](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=16))

> "In the early 1960s Julius Nyerere, then the leader of independent Tanganyika (not yet Tanzania), declared that'former colonial countries had no role in the formulation and conclusion of treaties done during the colonial era, and therefore they must not be assumed to automatically succeed to those treaties'. Nyerere bluntly told Britain and the other Nile countries that he had no intention of adhering to the 1929 Nile agreement. Kenya and Uganda agreed with Nyerere. Egyptwhich benefited most from the now rejected agreementdid not, but there was nothing it could do about it." ([Furniss :136](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=17))

#### Egyptian resistance to changes of Nile ownership
 
> "The upstream riparian countries insisted they should not be bound by the 1929 and 1959 agreements because they were not party" ([Furniss :137](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=18))

### Nile Basin Commission (NBC)

> ". to develop the Nile Basin water resources in a sustainable and equitable way to ensure prosperity, security and peace for all its peoples . to ensure efficient water management and the optimal use of the resources . to ensure cooperation and joint action between the riparian countries, seeking win-win gains . to target poverty eradication and promote economic integration . to ensure that the program results in a move from planning to action" ([Furniss :137](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=18))

> "This was an encouraging development, but still left several unresolved issues and questions about the construction of the dam, how Ethiopia will operate it and the effect it might have on water supply to the downstream countries" ([Furniss :140](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=21))

### Water Security

> "Various attempts have been made to define water security more precisely. For example, Grey and Sadoff (2007, p. 548) define it as'the availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health, livelihoods, ecosystems and production, coupled with an acceptable level of water-related risks to people, the environment and economies'." ([Furniss :138](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=19))

^d545c6

> "This fateful decision to introduce the non-legal concept of'water security' which would, practically, mean anything a riparian country wanted it to mean, has been justified as an ingenious solution to'the thorny issue of existing treaties'. It is thus contended that'water security' will pave the way for a compromise as it, allegedly,'has the advantage of relegating existing treaties to the background in favor of the more dynamic and progressive principles of international water law" ([Furniss :138](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=19))

### Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD)

> "The GERD is located on the upper reaches of the Blue Nile, just upstream of the Sudan border, and is designed for hydroelectric power (HEP) generation" ([Furniss :139](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=20))

^5b6e45

#### Winners & Losers 

> "The GERD project triggered a new phase of antagonism between Ethiopia and Egypt. Ethiopia insisted it had a right to use the water to meet its growing need for electricity, but Egypt saw the dam as a threat to their water supply" ([Furniss :140](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=21))

> "in March 2015, following a change in Egyptian government, a new trilateral agreement was announced between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan" ([Furniss :140](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=21))
