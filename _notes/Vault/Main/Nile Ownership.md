*Riparian ownership is the traditional model applied when considering who owns the water in a river. Ignoring that river water is constantly moving is considered a flaw in the riparian ownership model. ([note on p.134](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=15))*


*11 countries with banks on the River Nile makes agreements on Nile water ownership very difficult ([note on p.134](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=15))*


*Colonial interests in Egypt and the cotton trade determined authority for Nile water use, without any input from nation states upstream. ([note on p.135](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F76U98DX?page=16))*
