New left wing government in Greenland could prove pivotal in the supply of raw earth minerals that need to be mined to be extracted. A left wing government is more likely to oppose the mining which provides essential materials for the production of goods, including mobile phones, defence equipment and wind turbines. The potential impact on the supply of materials for wind turbines demonstrate how complex environmental issues can be. Mining destroys entire ecosystems but wind turbines are key to reaching zero emissions by providing clean, renewable energy. Other areas of the work that contain these raw minerals include China, which would likely tighten their grip on the global economy as a result. 

Incidentally, China have commissioned enough coal fired power plants to cancel out any closures.
