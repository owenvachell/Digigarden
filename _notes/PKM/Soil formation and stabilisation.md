 Essay answer
Additionally, the trees that sequester carbon also provide a canopy that protects the rainforest floor during heavy rainfall. The protection afforded by the canopy helps to maintain stable soil. Deforestation in the Amazon removes this canopy. Without protection from the Amazons forest, the surface would flood and the soil would become easily eroded. Landslides on steep slopes become more likely as a result of destabilised soil. Inhabited areas that experience landslides often results in loss of life. Locals that live in the affected region are forced to relocate their homes. Further deforestation occurs to clear land for new homes which leads to increased likelihood of further landslides. A positive feedback loop is created where the problems created by deforestation cause further deforestation. Examples of this positive feedback loop can be seen in Peru where landslides “resulted in the deaths of 28 people and the destruction of 1245 houses” ([CITATION](highlights://Amazon%20Life#page=92)). Therefore, the soil stabilisation provided by the Amazons natural ecosystems is of enormous benefit to the local people that reside within the Amazon basin.

## Notes
Trees retain and provide protection from rainfall, which helps to prevent landslides.

#### Consequences of deforestation
  [Page 92](highlights://Amazon%20Life#page=92) 
> In many mountainous parts of the Amazon basin, such as on the steep slopes of the Andes (Figure 2.3), a combination of population pressure and increased building has led to the loss of forests and the protection they used to provide from landslides. Landslides caused by deforestation may lead to extreme loss of life and destruction of property. These events impact especially on poorer people, who are forced to clear land and build houses higher up the mountains. An example of this is seen in Peru, where sprawling shanty towns (favelas) are being built increasingly further up mountains, which in turn, leads to an increase in the rate of deforestation. In the first three months of 2015, for example, landslides in Peru resulted in the deaths of 28 people and the destruction of 1245 houses (International Business Times, 2015).
