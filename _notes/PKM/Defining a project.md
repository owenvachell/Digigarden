### What is the goal of your project?  


### What are the three objectives

#### Scope 
- requirements
- qualities
- specification

#### Time 


#### Budget
- Which of the three objectives is a constraint
	- what is limited
	- is there a budget or time that definitely cannot be exceeded?
	- is the scope pre-defined?
- What can be optimised
	- are we able to deliver the project as soon as possible
- What will need to be compromised

Each of the three objectives are constrained by each other, demand on one will require fle on another. 

For example, a project that must happen on a specific date is constrained by time. 
Optimising the scope will meaning providing as many bells and whistles as possible but will mean compromising budget.

|             | Scope | Time | Budget |
| ----------- | ----- | ---- | ------ |
| Constrained |       | X    |        |
| Optimise    | X     |      |        |
| Compromise  |       |      | X      |

The Clearwater Portal must be optimised for time. We are constrained by budget which means compromising on scope
