### Evidence
When responding to a discussion process word in essays, evidence will need to be produced that supports both sides. When writing reports, a recommendation may be required with evidence to support the decision and refute the opposite side of the argument.

Evidence sources need to be reputable and authoritative.

Including evidence adds weight to the assignment and allows readers to do their own research on your findings.

## Differences
The most obvious difference between a report and an essay is structure.

### Reports
Structure is divided into sections (which may be numbered). The shape is obvious and can be seen before reading.

Discuss facts

Language is formal and more direct. Avoid first person.

Can include diagrams and data visualisation

Anything that may distract from the main flow should go into an appendix

#### Potential Structure
1. Title
2. TOC
3. Summary or executive summary
4. Key points/findings
5. Methodology
6. Main body
7. Conclusion
8. Acknowledgements
9. References
10. Appendix 

#### Checklist
- Is the title appropriate and meaningful?
- Does the report meet the given purpose?
- Is the purpose or objective clear?
- Does the Introduction set the background to the report?
- Does the Introduction outline the way the report is organised?
- Have you checked all facts and figures?
- Are all sources that you have referred to (cited) also in the References?
- Are all the sources in the References cited in the report?
- Do the sections have appropriate headings?
- Does the report flow logically?
- Is the writing style concise?
- Are all diagrams and images labelled?
- Have you checked your spelling and grammar?

* TOC
* Summary and key messages and recommendations mentioned at the beginning. Summary as a paragraph. Key points as bullets or numbered lists
* There is a clear outline of sections and sub-sections 
* Introduction includes the aims or purpose of the report. This should consider the target audience and set the out the way the report is organised 
* Starts with summary > key points > Introduction
* Finished with conclusion > acknowledgements > references

### Essays
Structure is written in continuous prose with a logical flow between paragraphs. The shape is not apparent until the essay is read.

Discuss issues or present arguments for or against with supporting evidence.

Discursive language with linking words and phrases that help to form the shape (mentioned above).

Would not usually include visual elements.
