We access the water cycle between precipitation and discharge into the sea by a process called abstraction.

When it comes to the use of technology, the most up-to-date solution is not always the right answer. For example, installing a flushing toilet in Ethiopia would use excessive amounts of water on each flush in a region where supply is already sparse. Furthermore, installing flushing toilets is expensive which would  mean the affluent community using up Ethiopias water supply.

## River supply
- Supply
	- Surface water
- Hardware
	- Jerrycans
- Maintenance
	- No resources required to maintain, other than human labour and water
- Factors affecting quantity of water
	- Rainfall – amount and seasonal variation, vegetation cover.
- Potential sources of pollution
	- Turbidity caused by rain and soil erosion, pollution from animals, humans, agriculture, possibly industry
- Stakeholders
	- Users

## Well and pump supply
- Supply
	- Ground water
- Hardware
	- Well, pump and jerrycans
- Maintenance
	- Initial cost of pump, continuing need for maintenance
- Factors affecting quantity of water
