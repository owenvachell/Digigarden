Remember: when coming up with a research question, it's important to consider how it might be framed from the view of [[Positivism, constructivism and realism (pragmatism)]]

- use data to answer well defined questions
	- maintain focus on this
- make recommendations and regularly monitor its implementation
	- for example, a recommendation might be 'we need to do more research to better understand the issue'
- make a proposal
	- research question
	- aim
	- brief description for the method and frequency of data collection
	- why this research is important
	- how could it be used to inform a course of action?
- make a hypothesis
	- a hypothesis makes a prediction that the research will aim to prove. the research must be continuously tested against this hypothesis. A null hypothesis must also be created to predict what might happen if the hypothesis isn't correct
- create propositions
	- This is called deductive reasoning - making a statement and trying to prove that you're right. Conversely, inductive reasoning are propositions that take what we already know to make generalisations.
