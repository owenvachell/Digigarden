### History
Traditionally used for subsistence fishing/farming that supplied the riparian population. Artisinal methods employed by local fisherman provided approximately **100,000 tonnes** of fish per year up until and including the 1970’s.

Over 500 endemic[^1] fish species existed in Lake Victoria until the introduction of Nile Perch, a non-indigenous and predatory species.

[^1]: found only in a specific location and nowhere else. something that’s endemic is also indigenous. Something that is indigenous is not necessarily endemic.
