## British Antarctic Survey 
**Past**
The BAS use ice cores as ‘time capsules’ to produce records of atmosphere and climate conditions. This is made possible by the visible layers of annual snowfall.

Bubbles in the ice tell us what GHGs were in the atmosphere up to a million years ago. As global temperature is closely correlated to the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere, this data can tell us what the climate was like.

**Present**
Measuring salinity and temperature of the ocean can tell us how much heat is in the ocean. Scientists have shown how much of that heat is flowing towards Antarctica, which is melting the ice there at a rate of 10m per year.
