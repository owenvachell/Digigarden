## Making the case

- **general background (the why) - 300 words**
	- key concepts
		- ==Think about how each of these applies specifically in the context of transport==
		- growing urban populationon
			- which means more cars

			- **page 3:** 
				- > In 2007, humanity passed a significant milestone, represented in Figure I.1 at the point where rural and urban populations are the same (where the urban and rural lines on the graph intersect), at which point 50% of the global population lived in urban settlements. By 2016, just over 4 billion people lived in urban areas, or 55% of the global population of 7.5 billion, and it is projected to rise to 70% of a global population of 9 billion by 2050 (UN, 2016). In other words, in just under 35 years, or little more than a generation, the population of cities will increase by two-thirds, from 4 billion to 6.5 billion
		- increasing emissions
			- **page 4**
				- > Although cities and towns, and the people who live in them, occupy only a fraction of the world’s land area, their global impact is immense. They already account for much of the world’s production and consumption. For example, according to the United Nations (UN, 2012), they are responsible for around 80% of global energy consumption and 75–80% of greenhouse gas emissions
		- increasing pollution
			- **page 27**
				- > Air pollution is now recognised as one of the key environmental and health problems of this generation. Globally, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA): ‘Around 6.5 million deaths are attributed each year to poor air quality, making this the fourth largest threat to human health, behind high blood pressure, dietary risks and smoking’
			- **page 28**
				- > This section is concerned with the effect of air pollution on human health, but many pollutants also have strong impacts on natural ecosystems, most notably on growing plants. For example, the acid rain arising from sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions caused widespread damage to trees in much of western and eastern Europe in the second half of the 20th century. Groundlevel ozone and PM can stunt the growth and development of plants and crops. Freshwater ecosystems are also affected by acidification from excess nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere. ==Globally, particulate matter is the most damaging pollutant for human health==
				- > The predominant cause of outdoor air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels, mostly coal and oil, by power stations, industries and ==transport== across the world
		- greater risk of flooding
		- heatwaves
		- biodiversity
			- **page 141**
				- > Cities are now significant providers of habitats for biodiversity, and one important aspect of the city is how wildlife is adapting to urban environments
				- peregrine falcon example on p142
		- There is an argument that making existing urban areas more sustainable can have the most positive impact for mitigating.....
			- **page 150**
				- > Some are also critical of the eco-city movement and say that eco-cities are neither practical nor even desirable. They would point out that there are few, if any, existing cities or towns that meet these strict criteria. Others, who are in favour of the concept, would argue that it is far more effective at the moment to concentrate efforts on reducing the impacts of existing urban areas, where over half of the world already lives
	- considerations
		- health risks
			- vulnerable members of the populationthe population
				- **page 38**
					- > three particularly vulnerable groups can be identified: children (aged under 14), those over 65, and those with chronic conditions such as asthma who are affected by poor air quality
			- inequalities
		- highlight importance of:
			- adaption
			- mitigation
			- resilience

## Proposal
![[TMA07 Questions#Proposal]]

- Improve school transport - 225 words 
	- main features
		- **page 44**
			- > an initiative by Transport for London called STARS to get schools to adopt a School Travel Plan to reduce the number of car trips to a school site and raise awareness about air pollution and road safety. Most parents are unaware, for example, of the high exposure inside vehicles. According to the STARS website:
			- > ==Each year STARS schools replace 13 million miles worth of car journeys with walking, cycling and scooting==

				- the levy is passed on to staff that use the parking spaces
				- non-residential workers are more likely to commute and therefore biggest contributors to emissions and pollution. [They also earn a higher average wage than residential staff](https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/5.16%20Congestion_report_v03.pdf)

- Promote air quality - this could possibly fit with improving rail links. The railway line runs parallel to Ashley road (one of the AQMA sites) and there's a train station on Ashley Road with connections to Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch

> **Methods**
Each individual can make a contribution to reducing air pollution where the smallest action can result in large benefits. Examples of actions in where you can reduce air pollution are:
>
>not using your car for short journeys
walk, cycle or take the bus or train instead of using a car
share your car journeys with friends and family
>
>**If you use your car**
maintain your car efficiently, having your car serviced regularly and keeping the correct tyre pressure
drive smoothly and do not rev your engine unnecessarily which will save fuel and emit less pollution
turn off the engine when your car is stationary
avoid heavily congested areas
