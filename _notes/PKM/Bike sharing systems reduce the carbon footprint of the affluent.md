There is evidence to suggest that bike sharing systems (BSS) are unequally accessible to more affluent members of the population. While it's important to balance the equity of BSS, it should also be noted that wealthier people typically have a higher carbon footprint. Therefore, it is important that this carbon footprint is reduced which can be aided by BSS.
