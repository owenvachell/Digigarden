## Definition
sovereignty can be defined as an exclusive right to have control over a territory and people

## Problems

* Indigenous peoples with no written right to land or state structures - interests ignored
	* Campaigns by indigenous peoples for legal settlements and rights
	* Who takes responsibility for environmental problems eg. Effect of carbon emissions in UK being felt in Asia

## Origins

* French Revolution saw a shift in thinking about who holds sovereign power, moving it away from a sovereign being, with authority derived from a notion of divine or God-given right, towards the population of a nation state – the citizenry
	* This way of thinking has its roots in the Peace of Westphalia of 1648, when, after the very destructive Thirty Years’ War, Europe’s monarchies agreed to recognise each other’s right to rule their own territories without interference from neighbouring sovereign powers
		* This agreement can be considered the source of all modern international law

## Powers

* set and raise taxes
* make and enforce laws
* control the police and the army within their borders

## Question of sovereignty

* Who has the right to access resources such as minerals and gas
* Sovereignty claims can be made on the basis of evidence that demonstrates the extent of a nations continental land mass
	* Bathymetric maps help to prove this
	* Conflicting claims can be resolved by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea
		* Ratified by almost all maritime countries. USA is the most notable absentee
		* Environmental campaigners would rather see a very different legal approach taken to protect the Arctic environment, similar to the Antarctic Treaty of 1961, which bans the exploitation of natural resources in that region. But that approach is also in danger of forgetting communities with an even greater interest in the future of the region.
