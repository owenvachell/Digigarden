Thought while seeing headline of an article from The Times explaining how heatwaves are killing hundreds of Britons every year. This has just been studied in my Geography ‘cities’ block. Heatwave problems are exacerbated in urban heat islands. Old people and children are most vulnerable to heat waves. The impact of this can be mitigated with more trees which can act as air conditioners. There is a section about this in my MarginNotes from the cities block. 

As a result of the heatwaves, people are flooding to seaside towns to make the most of the warm weather at the beach. This causes rising pollution and makes the problem worse. Furthermore, transport infrastructure in small towns can’t cope with excessive volumes of traffic. 

However, the economy of seaside towns typically rely on visiting tourists which people depend on for their livelihood
