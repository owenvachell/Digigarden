- experimental
	- a controlled environment for testing the hypothesis about cause and effect
	- variables can be tested in isolation
- observational (descriptive)
	- examine naturally occurring situations to see if predictions can be made in similar situations
	- likely to include a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data
- correlational
	- analysis of statistical relationships
	- eg:
		- positive correlations
		- negative correlations
		- null correlations
- comparitive
	- comparing and contrasting of two different situations beyond our control
- simulations
	- replications of the real world at a smaller scale to see how things react to changing variables that we can control
