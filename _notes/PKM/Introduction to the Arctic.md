## Welcome to the Arctic (Video)
Noted the use of some popular buzzwords associated with the Arctic:
- Remote
- Distant
- Mystical
- Vast (>5 million sq miles, covering all 24 time zones)
- Extreme
	- -50 degrees and always dark, to constant light

The Arctic is inhabited by:
- Whales
- Seals
- Polar Bears
- >4 million people
	- life is ruled by ice

The balance of the arctic regulates the world temperature.

### Arctic Ice Loss - Winners & Losers
There are winners and losers to ice loss in the Arctic:
- **Winners**:
	- Shipping
		- New commercial and cruise shipping routes
	- Energy
		- Access to untapped resources
			- **Below notes from ‘CBSN drilling ban’ video :**
					- Obama administration implemented ‘permanent’ drilling ban in the arctic.
					- Low oil price meant there’d be no incentive for the incoming Trump administration to try and reverse this order.
- **Losers**
	- Wildlife (habitat shrinking)
	- Local communities
		- **Below notes from ‘Cruising the Arctic’ video:**
			- Increase in tourism drives away marine mammals (excess noise etc) that are usually hunted for food. 
			- Groceries are prohibitively expensive and therefore not a viable alternative.
				- This is because of the freight cost to deliver groceries to the Arctic (See p.181)
			- It’s not just the cost of groceries, but additional costs such as fuel to drive there. Additional fuel is also needed if hunters need to drive further for their catch.
			- Hunting catch is shared throughout the community, so the above point impacts on everyone.
		- **Below notes from ‘Polar Bear Clink’ video:**
			- Polar bears are having to be sedated and airlifted via helicopter after being found ‘dangerously close’ to towns.
			- They are dropped further along their natural migration route.
				- **Why is this happening?**
					- Are bears having to search further for food? 
					- Are bears looking in new areas for food because of ice loss?
					- Has population growth encroached on their natural migration routes?



## Ways of knowing the Arctic (Audio)
Looks at the past, present & future of the Arctic and asks why is there such a strong attraction to explorers and storytellers.  Participants romanticise the Arctic, explaining that it takes a different kind of scientist that has a strong bond to such feelings as the “crunch of the ice under your feet”.

Some suggest there is a disconnect between people and the arctic, highlighting the lack of real estate given to the polar regions on maps and the remoteness of the region. My personal thoughts agree but are also based in the way we romanticise the Arctic, as mentioned above. Moreover, the arctic is often discussed from the perspective of an authoritative third-party, rather than the first hand stories of local peoples.

Art is important as society has a dependency on imagination when considering the arctic. Inuit art has become an untraditional yet important source of income to support their livelihood. 

## Cape Farewell
An expedition to the Arctic of scientists and artists that highlights the many different problems and Amy’s of thinking about the arctic. As is argued by the expedition director, David Buckland, art plays an important role in helping to translate important scientific discoveries for general understanding within society.

1. Marcus Brigstocke (comedian) discusses the importance of creative engagement with the arctic to prevent ‘climate change fatigue’, suggesting that people are becoming bored by the subject before any meaningful change has been implemented.  Argues that we would think differently about climate change if we could see it, like a crisp packet in a hedge.
2. Karen Filskov (guide and web producer) highlights the important aspects of the Arctic peoples culture that is often not understood by ‘the South’. Hunting and eating seal from a very young age may seem shocking to the rest of the world, but is essential for Arctic people to survive. for example, the nutrients from seal help to keep them warm in ways that vegetables and other meats wouldn’t. This is also a matter of their identity.
3. The seabed is being mapped by British Geological Survey (BGS) Geoscientists Carol Cotterill and Dave Smith using hydrophone technology. Their work aims to help them understand past environmental changes.
4. Ludvig Hammeken (guide and student) talks about the winners and losers of retreating sea ice.  As discussed earlier in [[#Arctic Ice Loss - Winners Losers|winners & losers]], retreating sea ice means more access to untapped resources and new shipping lanes. However, this is at the expense of local ecology. For example, Ludvig explains how rain and snow are being experienced in June for the first time. The changing climate also affects seal behaviour patterns , which in turn impacts hunting activity, as does inclement weather. The importance of hunting to local communities was demonstrated in no. 2.
5. Carol Cotterill (sea also: 3) discusses more aspects of her work. this time the focus is on separating the anthropogenic effects of climate change from natural processes.
6.  Michelle Noach is an ‘artoonist’ who’s work is inspired by the purposeful methods witnessed while watching the scientists work.
7. Emily Venables is an oceanographer from the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS). She studies the temperature, currents and salinity of ocean water. Water is more dense when it is colder and has a higher concentration of salt. When it is dense it becomes heavy and travels south. The dense water displaces the warmer water at the equator. The warmer water begins to cool as it is forced north, starting the cycle over again. Emily uses an ‘Argo Float’, which is deployed into the ocean. The float seeks out a body/pocket of water of ~equal temperature and salinity, where it will travel with the water and periodically transmit data until recovered. Argo Floats exist on a global network that help to understand ocean movement patterns.
8. Mojisala Adebayo is writing a play about disputed historical facts around who was the first explorer to reach the North Pole. The play focuses on the betrayals between humans and nature.
9. As mentioned earlier (this section intro) David Buckland is the Cape Farewell Director and argues that artists have an important role to play in helping society understand important discoveries made by scientists.
10. Sunand Prasad is an architect that suggest thoughtful design and town planning are essential in tackling climate change as half of our GHG emissions are from buildings. Sunand insists we can all live better lives by waking up to climate change, and this should be driven by individual and professional  actions. However, he believes the most important driver is policy change.

### Climate ‘Contrarian’ Audio
Underlying thoughts: 
- There’s enough data out there for anyone to spin their own narrative, depending on their own beliefs. 
- We must be tactful when labelling groups with differing schools of thought.
- Ice loss is an irrefutable, easily measured and easily provable fact that points to global warming.
