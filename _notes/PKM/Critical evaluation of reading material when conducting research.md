When it comes to evaluating the credibility of what you’re reading, keep the following questions in mind.

-   Is it reliable?
	-   reputable data
		-   are the results just a one off?
		-   how might the sample influence results
			-   consider age and socio-economic groups. For example, health data will be naturally different for older people than it will for younger people 
	-   trustworthy
	-   who's the source?
-   Is it valid?
	-   ‘Are the research outcomes based on an accurate analysis of the cause and effect, or are there other factors at play?’
-   Is it accurate?

	-   look out for research that quotes statistics with little details of the samplek out for research that quotes statistics with little details of the sample
		-   example given by Future Learn course
			- ‘70% more people prefer to eat beans than zucchini’, some immediate questions spring to mind.
				- Which people?
				- How many people were surveyed?
				- What type of beans were asked about?
				- What if we discover the conclusion is based on evidence drawn from a survey of 10 pre-school children, all aged between four and five? How does that impact on our research? What if we found out that some children surveyed had never eaten zucchini? How does that influence the accuracy of the result?
				- Also, what type of bean does the study refer to: green beans, lima beans, kidney beans or jelly beans? Isn’t this important information to include if we are hoping to determine the accuracy of the research?
