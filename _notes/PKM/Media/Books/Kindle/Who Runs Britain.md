Hers was radical surgery: a systematic reduction in the power of trade unions which reduced the bargaining power of employees; cuts in income tax to provide increasing rewards for incremental effort; reductions in benefits to create stronger incentives to take any kind of job; privatization of swathes of the public sector that improved basic services but also precipitated significant pay rises for those who ran the former nationalized industries.

By contrast, the gross median pay for full-time British employees in April 2006 was £23,600, up a mere 3 per cent on the previous year. So the typical FTSE 100 boss earned 75.2 times what the typical employee was paid – and just one year’s pay rise for that typical boss was £400,000, equivalent to 17 times the total pay of the typical employee.

It could, for example, be expensive for Labour as a political party to upset many in the City by imposing seriously higher taxes or tougher regulations on the operation of hedge funds and private equity in a way that curtailed their profitability, even if there was a strong public-interest reason for doing so. How so? Well, since 2001, the private-equity doyens Sir Ronnie Cohen and Nigel Doughty have contributed £1.8m and £1.005m respectively to Labour, the former Goldman Sachs partner John Aisbitt has given £750,000 and the hedge-fund

Any particular wealthy individual may have used state schools and hospitals when growing up. Or their employees may still use them. And their ability to generate wealth today depends in large part on the stability of the state and an expensive physical infrastructure. All of which costs money. So their determination to make the least possible contribution to what underpins their ability to enrich themselves – not even paying Gordon Brown’s slashed, paltry rate of capital gains tax – is grotesquely selfish.

It was striking how on 1 October 2007, the Shadow Chancellor, George Osborne, announced that a Tory Government would impose an annual levy of £25,000 on all those who register for non-domicile status, which would be on top of whatever other tax the non-doms pay to the Exchequer. It was a bold initiative for a Tory party which had been financed for years by donations from non-doms and those not resident here. But Osborne had been aware for months that his party’s core middle-class vote was increasingly fed up at what it perceived as the free ride being given to the rich.

So what do private-equity firms do? Well, although in detail their activities can seem bewildering and very complex, the essence is simple. They borrow money to buy companies, not a few shares in companies, but whole companies, in deals called ‘buyouts’.
```



```ad-highlight-general
title: Page: [29](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002V0921A&location=453)
it is in the use of borrowed money, or what private-equity and investment bankers call ‘leverage’. This is how to think about it. Let’s say you buy a house for £100,000 of your own money and it rises in value to £110,000 over the course of a year. If you were then to sell it, your percentage profit or return would be 10 per cent. But if you had bought it in the way that most of us would do, with a mortgage – well, then your return would go into the stratosphere. For example, if you borrowed £90,000 of the purchase price and used only £10,000 of your own money – which in City lingo would be your “equity” in the deal – then the sale at £110,000 would turn that £10,000 of equity into £20,000.

Throughout that year, financial institutions became increasingly anxious that they might have become too euphoric about private equity’s apparently stunning successes. They became fearful that in the finance that they had been providing for private-equity deals – known as buyouts – they had been lending too much, too cheaply and with too few strings attached. Concerns were raised about whether these lenders had been taking false comfort from their ability to insure their loans against default using the special financial insurance of credit derivatives or credit default swaps.

appears in retrospect to be an extraordinary example of greed-induced short-sightedness, the banks continued to lend billions and billions for the financing of private-equity deals, in the mistaken belief that they would then be able to sell on this debt in a repackaged form – as collateralized loan obligations, for example – to hedge funds, pension funds, insurers and other banks. What is more, they lent this money with fewer and fewer strings attached, in the form of ‘covenant-lite’ loans, which gave them diminished rights to seize control of a borrower or its assets in the event that it ran into difficulties. Suddenly, in July 2007, there was a rude awakening when all the big banks found that no one wanted to take off their hands the loans they had made to private-equity deals. Try as they might, they simply could not sell on this debt. They were stuck with somewhere between $300bn and $400bn of this unwanted leverage or loans. Much of this unsellable debt related to US buyouts, but it also included billions of pounds of bank loans to Alliance Boots and to a merger of two British private-equity-owned companies: Saga (the financial services, travel and publishing group aimed at the over-50s) and the AA (the roadside-recovery business). At the time of writing, attempts are being made to re-create a market for this private-equity debt. Some banks are trying to sell it to investors for prices below 100 cents in the dollar – which means that those banks are suffering a loss on those disposals. Even banks that are not selling are recognizing that they lent the money too cheaply and are therefore writing down the value of the loans in their balance sheets – which is their way of saying that they have been stupid and expect to make losses on these loans. Collectively, the banks which made these loans – led by the world’s biggest bank, Citigroup, and also including UBS, JP Morgan Chase, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland – will suffer billions of dollars in losses, probably somewhere between $10bn and $20bn in aggregate (my estimate is that they will lose around £13bn).

the banks in providing the credit too cheaply. They are in effect suffering from an adjustment in the market price of debt. If any of the actual buyouts, the acquired companies, were one day to run into difficulties – which well they might in a prolonged or severe economic downturn – then the losses on loans could escalate painfully. Until the banks have cleared their books of this debt, none of them are prepared to provide new substantial loans to private-equity firms wanting to make big takeovers. Which means that, for now at least, the private-equity deal binge has come to a juddering halt.

The eminences of British private equity, together with their lawyers and bankers, had – for the first and perhaps only time – gathered together to celebrate their mutual success and to ‘give something back’. The glittering throng met on 24 January 2007 at north London’s magnificently refurbished performance venue, the Roundhouse – which was famous in the 1960s for dope-infused, avant-garde, psychedelic circus and rock, and now supplements its income by selling hospitality to Britain’s uber-class of plutocrats. What a symbol of a changing Britain and a changing world.

Many of those at the Roundhouse were worth several tens of millions of pounds each, some were worth comfortably more than £100m. According to one banker who was there, the collective net worth of attendees was well over £10bn. They were launching the Private Equity Foundation, a new charitable trust endowed by private equity’s leading firms and individuals. It was part of a charm offensive by an industry that was suddenly attracting attention and criticism. The private-equity executives were demonstrating that some of the fat returns generated by their wholesale purchase of companies would be ploughed back into good causes. But the start-up funding received by the charity, of £5.1m, didn’t look particularly generous in the context of the industry’s colossal net worth.

The real theatre was happening outside the Roundhouse, where members of the GMB trade union were handing out sick bags. For over a year, the GMB had been protesting on behalf of members who felt they were victims of the ownership of their respective businesses by private-equity funds. It was trying to raise awareness of job cuts at the AA, the roadside-breakdown business, after it had been bought by two private-equity firms, CVC and Permira, and of a factory closure at Birds Eye, the frozen-foods business owned by Permira. The trade unionists have focused much of their campaign on Damon Buffini, who was then the managing partner of Permira and has since been appointed chairman.
```



```ad-highlight-general
title: Page: [35](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002V0921A&location=538)
Buffini is hardly a traditional target for a trade union campaign of humiliation. He is the antithesis of lazy inherited privilege. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands by a single mum, he’s black and he went to local state schools – before winning a place at Cambridge University and then embarking on a long career at Permira, where he’s become one of the most powerful capitalists in the UK as the head of Europe’s largest private-equity business. An Arsenal-supporting family man, he lives in south London and does his best to lead a normal life, when he’s not in some far-flung part of the world overseeing Permira’s sprawling network of acquired businesses, whose value at the time of writing was €65bn (£46bn). It has been quite a career trajectory, and even the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, is a Buffini fan. He has co-opted Buffini on to his Business Council for Britain – which brings together the UK’s business superstars to advise him on how to improve the competitiveness of the UK – and on to the National Council for Educational Excellence, where business leaders discuss with educational representatives how schools can be improved.

British-based private-equity firms were able to raise £34bn for investment in 2006, almost four times what they raised in 2003 (according to figures from the BVCA, the British Venture Capital Association).
```



```ad-highlight-general
title: Page: [36](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002V0921A&location=566)
There is a second important qualification, which is that money raised by UK firms would not necessarily be invested in the UK. Permira, for example, buys companies all over the world. Equally, US funds – like Blackstone and Texas Pacific – frequently buy in the UK. So these numbers indicate the massive fire power of private equity – without saying terribly much about how many British businesses have been, or will be, bought by private equity. In fact, for the 20 biggest UK private-equity groups, only 38 per cent of their investment was in the UK during 2004 to 2006.

The giants of the private-equity industry are American firms, notably Blackstone, Texas Pacific, Carlyle and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In the US, even the division two firms, such as Apollo, Bain and Warburg Pincus, are pretty colossal. The grand-daddy is KKR, which made billionaires of its three founders (two of whom, Kravis and Roberts, are cousins).

And in the UK, it received unwanted publicity through its ownership of Gate Gourmet, the airline catering business where a strike in August 2005 brought British Airways to its knees. The man who helped to facilitate a settlement of that industrial dispute – at the request of TPG’s founder, David Bonderman – was Lord Stevenson, a businessman with fingers in more pies than most (he is governor of the Bank of Scotland and chairman of its holding company, HBOS; and he features in this book both as the chairman of the House of Lords Appointments Commission, whose rejection of three Labour nominees for peerages helped to precipitate the cash-for-honours police inquiry, and as an ally of Sir Philip Green in his bid for Marks & Spencer).

There’s nothing either heroic or scandalous about what happened at Travelodge. It’s a story of a business being managed better than its rivals and better than it had been under its previous owners, Compass, which is a large publicly listed company. So if that’s what private equity does, why all the fuss? There are a bewildering number of possible answers. But I think the important ones are in fact implicit in Travelodge’s rehabilitation – and they tend to be related to how the employees in companies bought by private equity frequently undergo massive and unsettling changes in their working practices for which the rewards go disproportionately to senior managers and owners.

thanks to the generosity of the Chancellor in cutting the rate of capital gains tax on such investments, Buffini and his colleagues would pay no more than 10 per cent tax on the millions they would each make from the deal (in practice, they would probably pay just 5 per cent, as a result of the way that notional costs are imputed to them). Compare their rewards with the experience of the cleaners at Travelodge. As I mentioned, Permira says that the time taken to clean a room has been reduced from 40 minutes to 25 minutes. Grant Hearn, Travelodge’s chief executive, tells me that the cleaning time is coming down to 20 minutes (as the cleaners learn from a specially made DVD produced by the company that shows them how to become super-cleaners). So the cleaners’ productivity will have doubled, it will have improved by 100 per cent. But only a fraction of this improved productivity will have been distributed to the cleaners in the form of higher pay.

But what if the Travelodge cleaners were rewarded better than most? How would the tax system then treat them, how much of any increment would they have kept? The Government provides billions of pounds to augment the pay of those on low earnings, largely through tax credits. But, understandably, it provides less financial support to the young and single. If Travelodge’s cleaners are in that category, they would have suffered from the abolition of the 10 per cent starting rate of income tax in the Budget of April 2007. Also, as a general rule, those on low pay can find themselves taking home less than 50p of every additional pound of pay they earn, because of the withdrawal of tax credits as income rises. So Travelodge’s cleaners probably keep a much lower proportion of any incremental pay they make than Mr Buffini and his colleagues retain from their spectacular gains. Is that fair? Is it appropriate for the tax and social-security system to be tilted to that extent in favour of private-equity executives and against those earning least?

According to the British Venture Capital Association, more than 70 per cent of funds flowing to UK private equity over the past six years came from abroad (or about £50bn of inward investment into private equity in total). And for the 20 largest British private-equity groups, 79 per cent of new funding came from outside the UK during 2004–06. So the purchase by private equity of British businesses represents a transfer of ownership to foreign interests.

private-equity-owned businesses typically borrow far more than any other kind of business. So when companies are acquired by private equity their taxable profits disappear – and so does their liability to pay corporation tax. Just to be crystal clear, when a private-equity company stops making taxable profits, that doesn’t mean it is doing badly. Quite the reverse, in fact. Private-equity owners deliberately load up their acquired businesses with just enough debt to wipe out the tax charge, because that allows them to take control of those businesses for a smaller outlay from their investment funds. In that sense, the taxpayer is providing a very significant subsidy to the capital gains that are eventually made.
```



```ad-highlight-general

One striking example is what happened to the tax liability of Debenhams, the department-store group, after it was bought by the private-equity firms CVC, Texas Pacific and Merrill Lynch at the end of 2003. In its last full year as a listed business, it paid £40m in tax on profits of £144m. But when Debenhams transferred to private-equity ownership, it appears to have stopped paying corporation tax and seems to have actually become a creditor of the Government. Its profit-and-loss account for the following year shows a tax credit of £9.3m and there’s a further tax credit of £13m in the 12 months after that to 3 September 2005. As for its cash-flow statements, these show a similar picture of Debenhams being a net beneficiary of payments from HM Revenue and Customs. Thus, in the 53 weeks to 3 September 2005, Debenhams actually paid £10.4m in tax, but then received £18m in the following half year, to leave it a net £8m in credit. Debenhams has now been refloated on the stock market and has not been performing brilliantly – which rather gives the lie to the notion that private equity always improves businesses. But the important point for our purposes here is that during the brief two years that Debenhams was owned by private equity, HM Revenue and Customs ended up paying money to it.
