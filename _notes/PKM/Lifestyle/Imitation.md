We’re more likely to adopt and keep habits that are aligned with the close/many/powerful

That is:
1. Those closest to us or that we spend most time with (close)
2. People in a group (many) “humans would rather be wrong together than be right by ourselves”
3. We imitate the behaviours of the powerful in order to try and stand out ourselves. 

Based on 2 and 3 above, it can be said that humans seek to fit in and then strive to stand out. 

If our behaviours can gain approval, respect and praise it will be seen as attractive.
