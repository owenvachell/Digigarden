## Structure
about choice architecture. make good things easier to do than not so good things. like 
- **routine**!
- having eailiy accessible fruit and veg instead of packets of crisps and chocolate
- joining a gym that's en route to/from work
- etc

## Systems
Have daily and weekly rituals
- pack gym clothes (if I join a gym)
- prep food the night before or at weekends
- mobility mornings

## Scheduling
Program all of the above stuff into my calendar. make time for me the same way that I'd make time for others and maintain the discipline to stick to it.
