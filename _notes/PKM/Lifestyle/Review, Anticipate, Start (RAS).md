- `The Thought:` Came to me when looking at a daily note. My structure is to review yesterday, anticipate tomorrow then start today. It reminds me to take stock of what's happened and prepare for what's to come. I like it because the intials spell out 'RAS', which stood for 'Replenishment At Sea' when I was in the Navy. This could be related to the idea of taking stock and making sure you have the stores needed to continue your journey. Also ties in well with my Matelot theme for '[[Daily Dits]]'
