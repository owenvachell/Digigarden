Start with the smallest version of a ha it as possible and stop while youâ€™re still enjoying it (or before it starts to feel like work. 

Read one page in a book
Write one line in a journal
Meditate for 1 minute

Think of all the steps needed to get to the habit in the first place and get used to doing those first. 

Example: 
1) I want to get to work early so I have time to study

To do that I need to get up at half 5 and reward myself (make it attractive)

To that I need to go to bed by half 9 to get w good nights sleep

2) I want to practice piano in the evening

Before I can practice piano I need to set it up

Before I can set it up I need to make the time

To make time I need to leave work at 5

To leave work at 5 I need to stop procrastinating 

To stop procrastinating I need to first realise when I am procrastinating and make it unattractive and difficult to do.
