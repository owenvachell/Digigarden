        - Frequency
			- Count of all items
        - Relative frequency
            - Frequency represented as a portion of 100%
        - Cumulative frequency
            - Sum of relative frequencies
            - ie sort relative frequencies in descending order and add each one to the next, starting frm the bottom. Final value should = 100%
        - Pareto principle
            - 80% of effects come from 20% of the causes
    - Types of Data
        - Categorical
            - Has cetegories, such as car manufacturers or seasons
            - Most common ways to visualise include:
                - Frequency distribution tables
                    - 2 columns
                    - category
                    - frequency (number of units)
                - bar charts
                    - More visually appealing way of representing frequency tables
                - pie charts
                    - Show a 'represeantative' frequency (all values in the pie sum up to 100%)
                    - Example:
                        - market share
                - \[Pareto\](https://dynalist.io/d/Mv6wrR-IctAjSinzctrN5ENn#z=s8pI6RPlhS4enMhWyGouBRz7) diagrams
                    - A type of bar chart with categories in descending order of frequency with the addition of a curve that shows cumulative frequency
        - Numerical
            - Discrete
                - Finite
                - Can be counted as a number of...
                - Example:
                    - grades
                    - glasses
                    - cars
                    - money
                    - vessels
                    - etc
            - Continuous
                - infinite
                - impossible to count
                - For example, weight can increase by an infinite amount but tiny amounts of an increase may not show up on a scale
                - Examples:
                    - height
                    - area (space)
                    - time
                    - weight
    - Measurement Levels
        - Qualitative
            - Nominal
                - Like categories
                    - Car manufacturers
                    - seasons
            - Ordinal
                - Ordered values
        - Quantitative
            - Interval
                - Do not have a true zero
                - Examples:
                    - Temperature
                        - 0 degC and 0 degC are different
                        - Exception is Kelvin (has a true zero)
            - Ratio
                - Have a true zero
                - Examples:
                    - No. of objects
                    - Distance
                    - Time
