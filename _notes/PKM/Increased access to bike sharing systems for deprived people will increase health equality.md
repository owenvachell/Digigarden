Bike sharing systems (BSS) can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate matter (PM) emissions by decreasing dependency on personal car use.  GHG and PM are significant sources of poor air quality issues. Air pollution is a major health concern which can unequally affect people in more deprived communities due to lack of options for escaping the city. By increasing access to BSS for deprived communities will, in turn, provide more access to physical activity. As result, physical health can be improved making people more resilient to poor air quality.
