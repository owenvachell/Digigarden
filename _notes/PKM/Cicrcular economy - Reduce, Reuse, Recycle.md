- only 8.6% of the global economy is considered circular
- potential opportunities exist for product-service based models, rather than product ownership. For example, leasing a washing machine instead of buying it. The machine would be collected and recycled by the manufacturer at the end of the lease.
- consider all components at every stage of a product lifecycle that can be re-used. For example, cloth from clothing can be re-used to make furniture, then re-used again to make something else
- attention must be given to reduce by-products during the production cycle in the first instance as that would reduce the chance for waste
