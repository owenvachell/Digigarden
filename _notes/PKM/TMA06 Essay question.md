#### Essay structure

	- Problem
		- growing consumerism
	- who's responsible
- food
	- changing diets
		- more energy intensive
	- creates a lot of waste
- waste

		- China's middle class
	- what they're doing to solve
		- China are burning waste to produce energy
- energy
	- problem
		- more energy to meet consumer demands and production requirements of 'growth at all costs' economy
	- including food
- pollution and air quality from waste and increased emissions
	- problem
	- who's responsible
	- what they're doing about it
		- national emissions trading scheme to encourage organisations to reduce emissions. [this is a form of taxation](marginnote3app://note/40ECF429-54B6-4CDF-B281-D4D5DECFC731)

- growth at all costs
	- requires vast amounts of energy as the country transitioned to an industrial economy
		- energy also needed to produce goods to suit changing consumer habits of a growing middle class
	- changing diets of a growing middle class. also relates to energy
	- MSW and food waste as a result of increased consumption (food and goods)
		- food waste being used as a solution to meet energy demands as part of a circular economy
	- more pollution


##### Food
- how are diets changing
	- moving from grains and vegetables to meat
- what are the environmental challenges as a result
	- greater energy required
	- not enough land for pasture 
	- feed imported from the Amazon
	- energy wasted when food is thrown away
- why is it the governments responsibility
- who else is responsible
	- middle class
- what are they doing to fix the problem
	- food burned for energy use
