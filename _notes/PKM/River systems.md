## Essay
Similarly, local people that depend on the Amazons river systems also benefit from the protections afforded by the Amazon rainforest. Affected services can include fisheries, fresh water, hydroelectric power and river transportation ([CITATION](highlights://Amazon%20Life#page=109)).  The soil stabilisation benefits mentioned above that prevent soil erosion also help regulate sediment in the river. Less stable soil in deforested regions is more likely to break up and fall into the river. Aquatic animals find it harder to breathe in water that is deoxygenating due to heavy sediment, resulting in declining fish populations. Fisheries that depend on a healthy fish population to make a living or to feed their families directly form the river earn less money and have less food to eat. Furthermore, water with high sediment levels is more difficult to filter. The added cost to sufficiently filter high levels of sediment from water so that it’s safe to drink can be prohibitive to some communities. 

`dams might also need a section of it's own. Explore the section on dams in part 3 in more detail`

In addition, soil that has been eroded can no longer absorb heavy rainfall. Stable soil is essential for steadily releasing rain water to rivers keeping water flow stable throughout the year. Steady, water flow allows hydroelectric dams to produce sufficient electrical energy year-round. Therefore, stable electricity generation from hydroelectric dams becomes a lot more difficult in the drier seasons as a result of soil erosion. With less electricity generated, local communities are potentially left without power.


`follow up with river transportation. there's potentially a lot to cover which means it might need a paragraph of its own.`



## Notes

Deforested regions experience heavier water flows. Water becomes turbid with sediment, deoxygenating the water.

### Beneficiaries
- fisheries
	- facilitates healthy fish populations
		- if soil run off 
- transport
	- rivers less navigable in turbid conditions
- hydroelectric power
	- without regulation ‘drip-feeding’ the river systems, water levels drop significantly during drier seasons, which means hydroelectric dams struggle with electricity production
- fresh water
	- water becomes more difficult to filter, making safe drinking water more expensive.
