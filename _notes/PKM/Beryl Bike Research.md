- there is a negative correlation between deprived areas and bikes per capita. See Excel spreadsheet joined with indices of. multiple deprivation
	- this means that the more deprived an area is, the less bikes per person there is
	- ==how could the local authority assist with this to help improve accessibility to bike sharing==
		- people living in deprived areas are less likely to be able to afford the bike hire
			- ==what would the alternative be and how much would this cost==
			- there should also be incentives to change peoples behaviour, particularly if people in deprived areas are opting for a more expensive private transport option
			- what is employment like
				- ==for those that have jobs, where do they typically work?==
				- could employers help?
				- there is already cycle to work schemes in place
				- an alternative scheme could help people afford bike shares
	- bike capacity seems disproportionately assigned according to total population levels
		- ==how does this compare with employed vs unemployed population?==
- bike capacity is clearly distributed to areas with more amenities
	- for example
		- shopping centres
		- hospitals
		- town centres
	- suggests the Beryl bike scheme is aimed at people that have a specific place to be, and less as a leisurely activity for roaming around
