To help you develop critical reading and thinking skills, practise applying the [CRAAP criteria](https://create.piktochart.com/output/16960394-deakin-library-craap-guidelines) to new information.

CRAAP is an acronym for:

-   **Currency.** Is the information likely to be outdated?
-   **Relevance.** Does the information meet your needs? Does it help to answer your questions?
-   **Authority.** Who wrote it? Are they likely to know what theyâ€™re talking about?
-   **Accuracy.** Is the information accurate? Is it supported by evidence? Can claims be verified?
-   **Purpose.** Why has it been written? What are the likely motives of the authors? Where is the boundary between fact and opinion, and has it been crossed?
