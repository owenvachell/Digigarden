The Nile is unusual because the volume of water gets smaller as it gets further away from the source. A reason for this is water lost by evaporation as it passes through Egypt's hot climate. The region also receives very little rainfall to replenish the rivers via the water cycle.  In addition, it has a small number of tributaries; The Blue Nile, White Nile and Atbara River ([note on p.143](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=24))
