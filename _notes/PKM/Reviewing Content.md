Anyone can publish content online so it’s important to think critically about what we consume, rather than take everything at face value.

## Websites

* **Who** - consider both the article author and site owner (if different).
	* Read the ‘About’ page
	* What authority do they have? If it is a medical site, is it owned by a hospital or doctor?
	* What is their reputation?
	* Is the content written objectively?
	* Is the site biased towards any particular view? This is not always a bad thing, they can be useful in some circumstances?
* **Why** - what is the purpose of the site/article
	* Also often explained on the About page
	* Does the site objective align with the article content?
	* Knowing whether the site is biased will help establish the reliability of the published information
* **When**
	* How long has it been since an article was published on the site?
	* Information on the site may be out of date it’s been a long time since an article was published.
	* Site stability is also a quality indicator

## Journals
**PROMPT** is a more comprehensive version of **WWW**, making it better suited to journal articles

- **Presentation**
Is the information presented and communicated clearly? 
Consider the language, layout and structure.
- **Relevance**
Is the article relevant to the topic you are researching?
Look at the introduction or overview to find out what it is mainly about.
- **Objectivity**
Is the article biased, or motivated by a particular agenda? 
Is the language emotive? 
Are there hidden, vested interests?
Method: for research reports
Is it clear how the data was collected?
Were the methods appropriate and can you trust it?
- **Provenance**
Is it clear where the information has come from?
Can you identify the author(s) / organisation(s), and are they trustworthy?
Are there references/citations that lead to further reading, and are they trustworthy sources?
- **Timeliness**
How up to date is the material? Is it clear when it was written? 
Does the date of writing meet your requirements, or would it be obsolete?
