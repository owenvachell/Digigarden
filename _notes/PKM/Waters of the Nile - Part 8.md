> "Fortunately for us, given the right conditions, water is able to cleanse itself of many pollutants by physical processes (such as deposition, dispersal and dilutionsee Box 1.1) and by the action of micro-organisms on organic matter. So not only is the quantity maintained by the action of the water cycle, but also the quality can be renewed by these natural processes" ([Furniss :152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=33))

Water is renewable in quantity and quality ([note on p.152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=33))

> "Water pollutants can include a wide variety of substances, such as organic matter, inert (i.e. unreactive) solids like sand and silt, pathogens (that cause disease), toxic chemicals including heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and others" ([Furniss :152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=33))

Types of water pollutant ([note on p.152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=33))

> "Point source pollution originates from a specific location that can usually be identified fairly easily, for example, a pipe that is visibly discharging wastewater into a river. Non-point sources, also known as diffuse pollution, extend over a wider and usually undefined area, and are much more difficult to identify. Surface run-off containing pollutants such as agricultural chemicals that seeps into a river along its banks, and possibly also through groundwater, is an example of non-point source pollution" ([Furniss :152](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=33))

> "Organic matter may be removed by biological processes as it is broken down by microorganisms. In addition, there are physical processes such as deposition, dispersal and dilution that all contribute to reducing the impact of water pollutants" ([Furniss :153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=34))

Ways of dealing with pollutants ([note on p.153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=34))

> "If the inputs of organic material are high, oxygen is removed from the water faster than it can be replenished. This can lead to complete deoxygenation of the water, with consequent death offish and other aquatic animals that depend for their survival on there being adequate oxygen dissolved in the water" ([Furniss :153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=34))

Potential for a positive feedback loop?

Oxygen is removed from a body of water in the process of respiration that takes place when micro-organisms break down organic matter. 

Large volumes of organic matter results in an increase of micro-organisms ([note on p.153](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=34))

> "In places without a sewer system or with minimal or no sewage treatment, used water and surface runoff will pass directly into rivers or ditches" ([Furniss :154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=35))

Linked with deoxygenation ([note on p.154](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=35))

Water system definition ([note on p.166](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=47))

> "This definition includes both the natural (hydrological) and the human (socioeconomic) elements of the system, and acknowledges the importance and complexity of the linkages between them" ([Furniss :166](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S87SA6XC?page=47))
