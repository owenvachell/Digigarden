### q1
![[Countries of the Nile Basin]]

### q2
* The source of the Blue Nile is in Ethiopia 1km down river and the height has dropped to approximately 400m. is twice the rate of decline as the White Nile and would suggest water flows much faster through the Blue Nile. ^5a8059
* The source of the White Nile is in Uganda 1800 metres above sea level at its highest point. 1km down river and the height has dropped to approximately 1.1km ^c98077

### q3
* Rainfall in nearly all of Egypt is less than 100mm per year, except the coast which gets up to 200mm per year. ^7586ac
* Most of Uganda receives 600mm per year. Western regions and the area around Lake Victoria receive more than 1400mm per year. ^6a411e

### q4
* The most dominant forms of land cover in the Nile Basin are bare areas and shrubland
* The areas of forest and wetland are in areas of high rainfall. In addition, the area around the Sudd is very flat, as shown in the land profile diagram. Flat land is prohibitive to water flow. ^005119

### q5

* The Nile flow rate at Dongola is highest in Septemeber when it reaches approximately 19km3 for the month. The lowest flow rate is March at approximately 2km3.
* The White Nile reaches a peak of approximately 4km3 in October, 15km3 less than Dongola. The minimum flow rate is approximately equal to that of Dongola at around 2km3. This small variation indicates that the White Nile contribution is steady throughtout the year.
* The Blue Nile flows at a maximum rate of just over 15km3 in August and is at its lowest in March and April at a little less than 1km3.

### q6
The areas of densest population are in:
* The Nile Delta and along the course of the river in Egypt, north-west Ethiopia, Lake Victoria, southern Uganda and parts of Tanzania.
* The land cover types in densley populated regions of Egypt are typically irrigated cropland and urban areas. In Ethiopia the predominant land cover types are shrubland and rain fed cropland. Around Lake Victoria the dominant land cover type is rainfed cropland.

### q7
Why the water of the Nile are more OR less important for:
* Egypt
	* The data shows that Egypt has low rainfall. Furthermore, Egypts population live mostly within the Nile basin (96%) and in areas of irrigated crops that draw water from the Nile. The water from the Nile is therefore of great importance to Egypt.
* DR Congo
	* The majority of landcover in DR Congo is forest with high rainfaill.  The population in DR Congo lies in areas of rain-fed crops which experience above average levels of rain fall. Therefore the population of DR Congo do not rely heavily on the Water of the Nile.
* Uganda
	* Almost all of Uganda's population lives within the Nile basin (99%). However, it has a good level of rainfall, which supplies the crops. So Uganda do not rely heavily on the waters of the nile.
