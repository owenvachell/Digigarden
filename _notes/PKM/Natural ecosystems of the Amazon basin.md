> Dominance in this sense refers to the most common (or abundant) species in an area. Thus, the Amazon rainforest is dominated by trees

> At the centre of what makes the Amazon so important are its estimated 390 billion trees (ter Steege et al., 2013). These trees shape the climate which allows the recycling of water, brought in as moisture from the Atlantic Ocean, to reach the Andes many thousands of kilometres inland. They protect the fragile soils from the torrential tropical downpours, and provide food for the incredible biodiversity and the communities that live there. As trees are removed, a tipping point may be reached where the whole system could collapse, with serious global implications
