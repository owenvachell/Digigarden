The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) is a large aquifer that shares international borders with Egypt, Chad, Sudan and Libya.  The four countries depend on the NSAS as an important supply of water for irrigation and domestic use.  When aquifers straddle borders, like the NSAS, it raises issues of ownership and potential conflict. Although the approach to the NSAS between the four countries seems amicable

Water can flow freely through the aquifer between the multiple borders. If the geology surrounding the aquifer alters, impermeable rock may block the water and prevent it from flowing.
