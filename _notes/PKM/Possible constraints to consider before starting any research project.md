Possible constraints to consider before starting any research project
- am i the right person to be doing this research?
	- am i qualified enough
	- do i have enough experience
	- do i have enough influence to affect any change needed identified in the results
- do i have the budget
- do i have the time
- is it achievable
- how will it benefit people, if at all
- do i have the support of the community I'm researching?
- is this the right time to be doing this research?
	- what might be happening geopolitically
	- conversely, is there nothing happening at all around the field i want to research, and therefore not going to be enough interest
