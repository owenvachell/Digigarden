A plan **IS**:
- a statement of **intent** NOT commitment
- should be revised often
- should anticipate the need to be flexible
- needs a system for checking [[Project success and failure]]
- the basis for executive time management

### Components
- scope
	- identify tasks and dependencies
	- identify schedule
	- duration and timeframe
- resources
	- consider [[Organisation and Stakeholders]]
- clarifying trade-offs
	- consider the triad of scope, time and budget in [[Defining a project]]
- needs a risk management plan to cope with potential obstacles
- bridges the gap between project initiation and execution, identified in [[Project Life-Cycle]]
- allows us to reflect on project objectives and how realistic they are
- a plan is always a work in progress and can be continuously happening, even during the execution phase
