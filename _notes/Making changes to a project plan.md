If the project needs to be shortened, the only way that can be done is by reducing the time for one or more tasks on the critical path. 

Tasks duration can be reduced by:
- eliminating unnecessary activities
- compromise on functionality
- cut corners
- outsource

Choosing how to reduce task duration will depend on what trade-offs were agreed between scope, time and budget in the project objectives.

**The critical path direction may change when reducing the duration of a task.**
