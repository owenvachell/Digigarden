# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

Thank you for visiting my digital garden. Unlike a blog, this is a place where I publish my 
thoughts as notes. Snippets of information that I have picked up on my continuous learning 
journey and expressed as my own interpretation. What's more, it's a place for cross 
pollination of ideas by linking notes together and growing new ideas and thoughts in the 
process of networked thinking.

Like most gardens, it's a continuous work in progress. 

Thanks for stopping by
